# Reactions

Reactions transform Jibril from a passive monitoring tool into an active security defense system. When security events are detected, reactions can automatically execute custom code to respond, remediate, or gather additional intelligence.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Structure

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for Jibril's Reactions feature:

### Core Documentation

- **[Overview](overview.md)** - Introduction to reactions and how they work
- **[JavaScript API](javascript-api.md)** - Complete reference for all available helper functions
- **[Configuration](configuration.md)** - How to configure reactions in detection recipes

### Practical Guides

- **[Examples](examples.md)** - Real-world reaction examples and use cases
- **[Best Practices](best-practices.md)** - Security and operational guidelines
- **[Common Errors](common-errors.md)** - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Performance & Security

- **[Performance](performance.md)** - Optimization guidelines and considerations
- **[Security](security.md)** - Security implications and safe usage patterns

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Start with the [Overview](overview.md)** to understand what reactions are and how they work
2. **Review [Examples](examples.md)** to see practical implementations
3. **Use the [JavaScript API](javascript-api.md)** as a reference while building reactions
4. **Follow [Best Practices](best-practices.md)** for secure and efficient implementations

## ðŸ”§ Key Capabilities

- **Process Management**: Terminate malicious processes automatically
- **Network Policy**: Block IPs and domains in real-time
- **File Operations**: Read configurations and write forensic evidence
- **Data Persistence**: Track incidents across reaction executions
- **Emergency Actions**: System shutdown and kernel panic in critical situations

Reactions provide powerful automation capabilities while maintaining strict security boundaries and performance considerations.

Jibril delivers complete observability through exhaustive monitoring of critical system elements:

* **Identity**: Users and Groups
* **Infrastructure**: Machines, Hostnames, and Namespaces
* **Storage**: Disks, Filesystems, Volumes, and Files
* **Execution**: Containers, Processes, and Threads
* **Communication**: Protocols, Domains, Ports, and Sockets
* **Data Movement**: Network Flows

This extensive coverage ensures no security-relevant activity escapes detection, providing the comprehensive foundation needed for actionable security insights and decisive response capabilities.

***

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Action Visibility</mark>

Jibril records every interaction with system resources, creating a comprehensive audit trail for both security analysis and operational monitoring:

**Lifecycle Events**

* Creation and Destruction

**Modification Actions**

* Truncate
* Link
* Rename
* Open/Close operations

**Data Operations**

* Read
* Write
* Seek
* Execute

**Advanced Interactions**

* Memory Mapping
* Synchronization
* Locking mechanisms

This detailed activity logging provides security teams with the precise chronology and context needed to confidently analyze system behavior, identify suspicious patterns, and respond to potential threats with complete information.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Advantages</mark> <a href="#key-features-and-innovations" id="key-features-and-innovations"></a>

**Data Immutability**

* Guarantees forensic integrity with tamper-proof capture
* Creates trustworthy evidence for security investigations

**Beyond Circular Buffers**

* Eliminates data loss during high-volume events
* Reduces architectural complexity for greater reliability

**Real-Time Event Delivery**

* Provides immediate threat visibility
* Enables rapid response to emerging security incidents

***

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Capabilities</mark>

**Integrated Kernel Status**

* Combines introspection and tracing in a unified tool
* Maintains complete awareness of kernel state

**Kernel Query Language**

* Enables precise, targeted data retrieval
* Supports sophisticated in-kernel analysis

**Intelligent Performance**

* Optimizes response times through query caching
* Leverages immutability for enhanced result delivery

**Proactive Security**

* Implements in-kernel rule matching for instant detection
* Identifies threats before they can cause damage

**Ecosystem Integration**

* Supports external data store plugins (SQLite, etc.)
* Facilitates seamless integration with existing security infrastructure

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Information Acquisition</mark> <a href="#efficient-information-acquisition" id="efficient-information-acquisition"></a>

Three Powerful Approaches

**Queries**

* Perform rapid system inventory checks and fingerprinting
* Access in-kernel stores for immediate system state visibility
* Enable efficient baseline security assessments

**Micro Events**

* Capture lightweight, efficient system activities
* Store only essential data: timestamps, flags, and keys
* Minimize overhead while maintaining complete visibility

**Continuous Detection**

* Implement interval-based queries to in-kernel data
* Proactively identify threats through pattern recognition
* Maintain persistent security monitoring without performance impact

These complementary methods ensure comprehensive security coverage while optimizing system resources—providing both the detailed visibility and performance efficiency modern enterprises require.

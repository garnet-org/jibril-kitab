# Sudoers Modification

## Quick Explanation

The `sudoers_modification` recipe identifies access and modifications to the sudoers files, a critical security event indicating potential attempts to discover or alter user privileges on a Linux system. This file defines which users can execute commands with elevated privileges, and unauthorized changes could lead to privilege escalation or bypassing security policies. Such modifications, detected during a CI/CD pipeline, suggest recent code changes may include malicious attempts to alter authentication processes, posing significant security and compliance risks.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: sudoers modification  
**Tactic**: [Privilege Escalation](../../mitre/tactics/TA0004.md)  
**Technique**: [Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](../../mitre/techniques/T1548.md)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Sudo And Sudo Caching](../../mitre/techniques/T1548.003.md)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The detection of modifications to sudoers configuration files is a critical security event that indicates potential unauthorized attempts to alter user privileges on a Linux system. The sudoers file is central in defining which users and groups can execute commands with elevated privileges, and any unauthorized changes to this file could lead to privilege escalation or the bypassing of existing security policies.

This event falls under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework's "Defense Evasion" tactic (T1036), where attackers modify authentication processes to evade detection. By altering sudo permissions, an attacker can execute commands that are normally restricted, potentially leading to further exploitation of the system through techniques such as credential dumping (T1003) or lateral movement (T1021).

The implications of such an event are significant as it directly impacts the integrity and security posture of the affected systems. If these changes go undetected, they could facilitate further malicious activities such as data exfiltration through DNS tunneling (T1048), system damage via malware execution (T1059), or persistent access for future attacks using persistence mechanisms like cron jobs (T1053).

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity, etc. Unauthorized changes in the sudoers file during a CI/CD pipeline can lead to immediate security risks such as elevated access rights beyond what is necessary for operational functionality. This could also result in compliance issues, especially in environments subject to stringent regulatory standards regarding access control and system management.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment. In the staging environment, modifications can expose critical vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit during pre-production testing phases. This could lead to unintentional or intentional leaks of sensitive information and allow insiders with elevated privileges to perform malicious activities.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT). In the production environment, unauthorized modifications can enable long-term persistence through mechanisms like cron jobs or scheduled tasks. Attackers could leverage these changes for lateral movement across systems, stealing credentials via tools like Mimikatz (T1003), and exfiltrating sensitive data using covert channels or DNS tunneling.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Immediately audit recent commits and changes in the pipeline that could have led to modifications in the sudoers file. Look for any unauthorized or suspicious changes.
2. **Implement Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to modify the sudoers file within the CI/CD environment. Consider using role-based access controls (RBAC).
3. **Conduct a Security Review**: Perform a comprehensive security review of the CI/CD pipeline to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Audit User Permissions**: Check the current user permissions and roles in the staging environment to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
2. **Verify Configuration Integrity**: Compare the current sudoers file with a known good configuration to identify unauthorized changes.
3. **Test for Vulnerabilities**: Conduct security testing to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited due to the modifications in the sudoers file.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response process to investigate the unauthorized modification and assess the potential impact on production systems.
2. **Restore from Backup**: If unauthorized changes are confirmed, restore the sudoers file from a secure backup to ensure system integrity.
3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Perform a thorough threat hunt to identify any signs of lateral movement, credential theft, or other malicious activities resulting from the modification.

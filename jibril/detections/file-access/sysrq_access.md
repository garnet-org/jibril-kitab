# Sysrq Access

## Quick Explanation

The `sysrq_access` recipe identifies access to critical system files associated with the SysRq key in Linux environments. This can indicate an attempt by attackers to impair defenses through interactions that could disable or bypass security mechanisms, posing a significant risk especially in CI/CD pipeline contexts where such actions could compromise overall security postures and allow unauthorized modifications.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Kernel system request file access  
**Tactic**: [Defense Evasion](../../mitre/tactics/TA0005.md)  
**Technique**: [Impair Defenses](../../mitre/techniques/T1562.md)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Disable Or Modify System Firewall](../../mitre/techniques/T1562.004.md)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The detection event `sysrq_access` is triggered when there is interaction with`/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq` or `/proc/sysrq-trigger`, critical files associated with the SysRq key in Linux environments. The SysRq key provides low-level access to the kernel, often used for debugging and recovery purposes. However, attackers can exploit this feature by modifying system processes that could disable security mechanisms, leading to defense evasion.

This event is categorized under Defense Evasion within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, specifically the T1036 technique (Masquerading), where adversaries use legitimate credentials or masquerade as legitimate users to evade detection. The critical importance of this event underscores its potential for significant security risks, including enabling deeper access and control over systems without being detected.

In real-world scenarios, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in software supply chains or insider threats to gain initial footholds. Once inside, they could use techniques like DNS tunneling (T1048) or covert channels (T1573) to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. Intrusion detection systems must be equipped with behavior-based detection mechanisms and anomaly identification capabilities to identify such sophisticated attack vectors.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity are heightened when `sysrq_access` events occur. Attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into builds or altering dependencies to gain low-level access to systems. This can lead to the deployment of compromised artifacts that enable persistent threats.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing could involve probing for weak points in staging environments, leading to data leakage and insider threats. Unauthorized access risks are significant as attackers might exploit vulnerabilities discovered during staging phases before production deployments.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) become more pronounced. Attackers can leverage`sysrq_access` events to disable security tools or alter critical configurations, thereby compromising the integrity of the entire infrastructure.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the source and intent of the `sysrq_access` event. Review logs and access records to identify unauthorized access or modifications.
2. **Audit and Harden Configurations**: Ensure that access to critical files like`/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq` is restricted. Implement strict access controls and audit configurations to prevent unauthorized interactions.
3. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Regularly review and update security policies to include best practices for handling critical system files and ensure compliance with security standards.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Security Assessment**: Perform a security assessment of the staging environment to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited through `sysrq_access`.
2. **Access Control Review**: Review and tighten access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with critical system files.
3. **Simulate Attack Scenarios**: Conduct penetration testing to simulate potential attack scenarios involving `sysrq_access` and evaluate the effectiveness of current defenses.
4. **Data Protection Measures**: Implement data protection measures to prevent leakage during adversarial testing or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Incident Response Activation**: Activate incident response protocols to address the`sysrq_access` event. Ensure that all relevant teams are informed and involved in the response process.
2. **System Integrity Check**: Conduct a comprehensive integrity check of the production environment to ensure that no unauthorized changes have been made to critical configurations or security tools.

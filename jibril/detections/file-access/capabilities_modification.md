# Capabilities Modification

## Quick Explanation

The `capabilities_modification` recipe detects changes to the capabilities configuration files. This event is critical as it involves potential defense evasion tactics where attackers may alter system configurations to manage special privileges, potentially leading to escalated privileges or unauthorized actions without triggering standard security alerts.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Capabilities file modification  
**Tactic**: [Defense Evasion](../../mitre/tactics/TA0005.md)  
**Technique**: [Modify System Image](../../mitre/techniques/T1601.md)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Patch System Image](../../mitre/techniques/T1601.001.md)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The `capabilities_modification` event is triggered when modifications occur in the capabilities configuration files within a Linux environment, specifically targeting changes to `/etc/security/capability.conf`. This event is significant as it involves potential defense evasion tactics where an attacker or malicious process attempts to alter system configurations that manage special privileges for executing files and commands. Such alterations can significantly impact the security posture of the system.

The use of file access mechanisms for this detection aligns with monitoring critical configuration files, which if improperly modified, could allow escalated privileges or unauthorized actions without triggering standard security alerts. This method falls under modifying the system image, a technique often used by adversaries to persist on a system or evade defenses by altering system configurations that are not typically monitored.

In line with MITRE ATT\&CK framework techniques such as T1086 (Taint Library), attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the capabilities configuration files to bypass security controls. This could involve DNS tunneling for data exfiltration, covert channels for command and control communication, or supply chain risks where trusted software is compromised at an earlier stage of development.

In conclusion, this detection highlights an essential security control within CI/CD pipelines and runtime environments that focus on maintaining the integrity of system configurations. It acts as both a preventive and detective control mechanism against unauthorized changes that could facilitate broader attack campaigns or system compromises.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Detecting unauthorized modifications to capability configuration files during CI/CD processes suggests an attempt to alter how applications and scripts gain necessary permissions on a host machine. If such changes were merged into production environments, it could lead to applications running with higher privileges than required, potentially resulting in escalated attacks or breaches. This scenario underscores the importance of rigorous code review processes and automated checks like Jibril in identifying and mitigating such risks before deployment.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, adversarial testing can reveal vulnerabilities that may not be apparent in development phases but are critical before production deployment. Risks include data leakage through insecure configurations or insider threats where unauthorized users gain elevated access to sensitive information. Ensuring robust monitoring and logging of system configuration changes is crucial for detecting such risks early.

#### Implications for Production

In the production environment, long-term persistence risks become more pronounced as attackers may leverage modified capabilities files to maintain a foothold within the network. Lateral movement becomes easier if an attacker gains elevated privileges, leading to credential theft and data exfiltration. Advanced persistent threats (APT) often exploit such vulnerabilities for extended periods without detection.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review and Audit**: Immediately review the recent changes in the CI/CD pipeline configurations and scripts that interact with `/etc/security/capability.conf`. Identify who made the changes and whether they were authorized.
2. **Enhance Security Checks**: Integrate additional security scanning tools that specifically check for unauthorized changes to critical configuration files during the build and deployment process.
3. **Update Change Management Policies**: Ensure that any changes to critical system files like `capability.conf` are subjected to strict review processes and require approval from multiple team members.
4. **Educate and Train**: Conduct training sessions for developers and operations teams on the importance of secure handling of system configuration files and the potential risks associated with unauthorized modifications.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Monitor and Log Changes**: Implement robust monitoring tools that log all changes made to system configuration files in real-time. This will help in quickly identifying and responding to unauthorized modifications.
2. **Conduct Security Audits**: Regularly schedule security audits in the staging environment to check for compliance with security policies and the integrity of system configurations.
3. **Simulate Attacks**: Perform red team exercises focusing on the exploitation of modified capabilities files to understand potential attack vectors and improve defensive strategies.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response protocol to assess the extent of the modification and its impact on the production environment. Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the source and method of the modification. This will help in understanding the attack vectors and in preventing future incidents.
3. **Restore from Backup**: If necessary, restore the affected configuration files from a secure backup after ensuring that the backup is free from any tampering or malicious modifications.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Enhance continuous monitoring capabilities to detect and alert on any unauthorized changes to critical system files immediately.

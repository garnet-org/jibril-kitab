# Environment Read From ProcFS

## Quick Explanation

The `environ_read_from_procfs` recipe detects when a process accesses the environment variables of another process via the `/proc/[pid]/environ` file. While this operation can have legitimate debugging or monitoring purposes, it may also indicate system information discovery or an exfiltration attempt. Environment variables often contain sensitive information such as credentials, API tokens, or other configuration secrets, making such access potentially harmful if abused. This detection highlights suspicious behavior related to recent code changes or pipeline activities.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: environ read from procfs  
**Tactic**: [Discovery](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0007)  
**Technique**: [System Information Discovery](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0007/t1082)  
**Importance**: High

### Analysis of the Event

This detection event focuses on the access to `/proc/[pid]/environ`, a file that contains environment variables for a specific process. Environment variables are frequently used to store sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or tokens required for application functionality. Accessing this file without proper authorization is a clear security concern and could indicate a reconnaissance effort or an active exfiltration attempt.

For example, an attacker could read `/proc/[pid]/environ` to extract sensitive credentials or access tokens used by critical processes. These could then be exfiltrated to an external server or used directly to gain unauthorized access to resources. The information could also reveal runtime parameters, configurations, or debugging flags, which may help attackers further exploit the system.

In legitimate contexts, access to `/proc/[pid]/environ` is commonly seen during debugging or monitoring. However, unauthorized or unexpected access to this file—especially multiple times or across multiple processes—should be treated as a potential indicator of compromise. The high importance of this detection underscores the need to promptly investigate the source of the behavior and mitigate any associated risks.

From a cybersecurity perspective, such an event could align with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1218 (System Information Discovery). Attackers might leverage these techniques as part of broader reconnaissance efforts or data exfiltration strategies. Forensic analysis would involve correlating the access attempts with network traffic, process behavior, and system logs to identify potential threats.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

The detection of environment variable access from the `/proc` filesystem raises significant security concerns within a CI/CD pipeline. It suggests that recent code changes, malicious scripts, or misconfigured tools might inadvertently or intentionally attempt to extract sensitive information. If merged into production, this behavior could lead to the leakage of secrets or critical system configurations, enabling attackers to execute unauthorized actions, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data.

For instance, exposed credentials could be used to access external services or APIs, potentially resulting in further compromise of infrastructure or data theft. This scenario aligns with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques T1074 (Data from Local System) and T1539 (Supply Chain Compromise), where attackers exploit the build process itself as part of their attack chain.

#### Implications for Staging

In a staging environment, adversarial testing may involve attempts to access`/proc/[pid]/environ` to gather sensitive data before production deployment. This could indicate insider threats or unauthorized access risks where developers or testers inadvertently expose critical information through misconfigured tools or scripts. Such activities can be detected by monitoring for unusual process behavior and correlating it with network activity.

#### Implications for Production

In a production environment, unauthorized access to `/proc/[pid]/environ` represents a significant risk as sensitive data could be directly exfiltrated. This type of attack often involves lateral movement within the network (T1027) and can lead to further compromise if credentials are used to gain access to other systems.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Examine any recent commits or merges for unauthorized code that might be accessing `/proc/[pid]/environ`. Focus on scripts or tools that have been recently added or modified.
2. **Conduct Security Audits**: Regularly schedule and conduct security audits on your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that there are no security gaps that could be exploited to access sensitive information.
3. **Educate Developers**: Provide training for developers about the security risks associated with handling environment variables and accessing system files, emphasizing secure coding practices.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Simulate Attack Scenarios**: Regularly perform security tests and simulations to check if environment variables can be accessed through `/proc/[pid]/environ` and to determine the potential impact.
2. **Tighten Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized personnel and processes have the necessary permissions to access critical files and directories.
3. **Verify Configuration and Deployment Scripts**: Check all deployment scripts and configurations for any unintentional commands or settings that might expose sensitive data.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: If unauthorized access to `/proc/[pid]/environ` is detected, initiate an incident response to determine the scope of the exposure and mitigate any ongoing risk.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to trace back the source of the access, examining logs, network traffic, and system activities around the time of the detection.
3. **Review and Restrict Access Permissions**: Review the access permissions on the`/proc` filesystem and enforce strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

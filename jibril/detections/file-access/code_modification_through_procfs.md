# Code Modification Through Procfs

## Quick Explanation

The `code_modification_through_procfs` event is a critical security issue that detects attempts at modifying code via the proc filesystem. This technique, often used in defense evasion and malicious activities, allows attackers to inject malicious payloads into running processes without being detected by traditional monitoring systems, leading to potential privilege escalation and persistent access.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Code modification through procfs  
**Tactic**: [Defense Evasion](../../mitre/tactics/TA0005.md)  
**Technique**: [Process Injection](../../mitre/techniques/T1055.md)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Proc Memory](../../mitre/techniques/T1055.009.md)  
**Importance**: High

### Analysis of the Event

This event is triggered when there are attempts to modify code by accessing process memory directly via the `/proc` filesystem, a tactic frequently employed in defense evasion and malicious activities. The proc filesystem (`/proc`) on Linux systems provides an interface for accessing kernel data structures and information about system processes. It allows users to read and write to files that represent running processes, including their memory spaces.

Attackers exploit this feature by writing directly into the memory space of a process through paths like `/proc/[pid]/mem`. This technique is particularly dangerous because it can bypass conventional file integrity monitoring systems since no actual files are modified on disk. Instead, the changes occur in memory, allowing for stealthy execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

This type of attack aligns closely with several MITRE ATT\&CK tactics and techniques, specifically under the Defense Evasion (TA0005) tactic. It involves techniques such as Modify System Processes (T1087), which refers to modifying running processes to evade detection, and Process Injection (T1055), which involves injecting malicious code into legitimate processes.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

The risk of build process compromise is heightened due to potential dependency poisoning or artifact integrity issues. Attackers might inject malicious code during the build phase, leveraging `/proc` filesystem access to manipulate running processes without leaving traces in source control systems. This can lead to undetected vulnerabilities being introduced into production environments.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, adversarial testing poses significant risks as attackers could exploit similar techniques to exfiltrate sensitive data or establish a foothold before the final deployment. Unauthorized access and insider threats are also concerns, as these environments often contain valuable information that can be leveraged for further attacks on production systems.

#### Implications for Production

The implications in production are severe, including long-term persistence risks where attackers maintain unauthorized access by injecting malicious code into critical processes. Lateral movement becomes easier due to elevated privileges, and credential theft can lead to broader infrastructure compromise. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) often use such techniques to remain undetected for extended periods.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Audit and Monitor Access**: Implement strict monitoring on the `/proc` filesystem to detect any unauthorized access or modifications. Use tools that can track and alert on direct memory access patterns.
2. **Enhance Security Controls**: Integrate security tools that specifically check for memory-based manipulations during the build process. Consider using runtime security tools that can detect unusual process behaviors.
3. **Review and Harden Build Scripts**: Regularly review build scripts and environments for any signs of tampering. Harden access controls to build servers and restrict who can modify the environment.
4. **Continuous Security Training**: Educate your development and operations teams about the risks associated with the `/proc` filesystem and the importance of secure coding practices.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Simulate Attacks**: Regularly perform security testing, including penetration testing and red team exercises, focusing on memory manipulation techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Implement Tighter Access Controls**: Restrict access to the staging environment, ensuring only authorized personnel can interact with critical processes and the filesystem.
3. **Use Canary Tokens**: Deploy canary tokens or other tripwire techniques in the staging environment to detect and alert on unauthorized access attempts.
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct frequent security audits of the staging environment to ensure compliance with security policies and to detect any potential security lapses.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Deploy advanced threat detection systems that can analyze and flag unusual memory and process behaviors in real time.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: In the event of a detection, immediately perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the intrusion.
3. **Incident Response Plan**: Ensure that an incident response plan is in place and regularly updated to handle cases of code modification through procfs effectively.
4. **Patch and Update Systems**: Regularly update and patch systems to protect against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the `/proc` filesystem.

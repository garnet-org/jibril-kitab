# CPU Fingerprint

## Quick Explanation

The `cpu_fingerprint` recipe detects access to system files that disclose detailed CPU architecture and configuration information. Such activity can precede more severe attacks by equipping attackers with hardware specifics for crafting exploits or optimizing malicious software. If this probing occurs during a CI/CD pipeline execution, it may indicate recent code changes that could expose sensitive system information, potentially aiding in crafting targeted attacks.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: CPU fingerprint **Category**: Discovery **Method**: System Information Discovery **Importance**: Low

### Analysis of the Event

The `cpu_fingerprint` detection event is triggered by attempts to access specific system files that could be used to gather detailed information about the CPU architecture and configuration. This action falls under the 'discovery' category, with the method being 'system\_information\_discovery'. The importance level is marked as low, indicating that while the activity might not directly harm the system, it can be a precursor to more severe attacks or exploitations.

Accessing files such as `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/sys/devices/system/cpu`, and similar directories using regex patterns suggests an attempt to understand hardware specifics, possibly for tailoring further attacks or optimizing malicious software. The MITRE ATT\&CK framework identifies such activities under the 'Discovery' tactic (T1082: System Information Discovery) where adversaries gather detailed information about the system's architecture, which can be used to tailor subsequent attack phases like exploitation and lateral movement.

In conclusion, while this detection alone does not indicate a breach or critical security threat, it highlights an interest in gathering sensitive information about the systemâ€™s hardware. This can provide attackers with valuable insights for crafting targeted exploits or optimizing malware that takes advantage of specific CPU vulnerabilities (e.g., Spectre/Meltdown).

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity include:

* **Build Process Compromise:** Unauthorized access during the build phase can lead to malicious modifications in code or dependencies.
* **Dependency Poisoning:** Adversaries may inject malicious packages or libraries that exploit hardware-specific vulnerabilities when executed.
* **Artifact Integrity:** Compromised builds can result in tainted artifacts that are deployed across environments, increasing attack surface.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment:

* **Adversarial Testing:** Malicious actors may use staging environments to test the efficacy of exploits tailored to specific hardware configurations.
* **Data Leakage:** Unauthorized probing can lead to sensitive information being leaked from staging servers, which could be used in future attacks.
* **Insider Threats:** Employees or contractors with access to staging environments might misuse their privileges for reconnaissance purposes.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT):

* **Persistence Risks:** Once attackers gain access to production systems, they can establish long-term footholds by leveraging hardware-specific vulnerabilities.
* **Lateral Movement:** Hardware information can aid in moving laterally across the network, exploiting known vulnerabilities on similar architectures.
* **Credential Theft:** Knowledge of CPU architecture can assist in bypassing security controls and stealing credentials for further exploitation.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Adversaries with detailed system knowledge can more effectively exfiltrate sensitive data through covert channels or DNS tunneling.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Examine recent commits and merge requests for any changes that might have introduced unauthorized access to system files detailing CPU information. Focus on modifications to build scripts or Dockerfiles.
2. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging**: Implement or enhance monitoring of file access patterns during the build process. Ensure that logs are detailed enough to capture unauthorized attempts to access sensitive files.
3. **Audit Dependencies**: Conduct a thorough audit of all dependencies used in the build process to ensure they are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with. Consider using tools that can verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies.
4. **Update Security Policies**: Ensure that your CI/CD pipelines are configured with strict security policies that limit access to critical system files and directories. Update these policies regularly to adapt to new security threats.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct Security Assessments**: Regularly perform security assessments and penetration testing in the staging environment to detect potential vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access to system information.
2. **Implement Access Controls**: Strengthen access controls to limit who can access the staging environment and what actions they can perform, particularly regarding sensitive system files.
3. **Secure Data Handling**: Ensure that all sensitive information, including details about system configurations, is handled securely and access logs are reviewed regularly to detect any unauthorized access attempts.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Harden System Configurations**: Regularly review and harden system configurations to minimize the exposure of sensitive information about CPU architecture and other system details.
2. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and regularly update an incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to unauthorized access to system information. Ensure that the plan is tested periodically.
3. **Continuous Security Training**: Provide ongoing security training for all team members to recognize and respond to security threats, including those that involve accessing sensitive system information.

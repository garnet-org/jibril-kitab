# OS Network Fingerprint

## Quick Explanation

The `os_network_fingerprint` recipe identifies access to network configuration files on a Linux system. This activity indicates efforts to gather detailed information about the host's network capabilities and configurations, potentially preceding more invasive actions if sensitive configurations are exposed. In a CI/CD pipeline context, such access may suggest recent code changes that interact with system-level network settings, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: OS network fingerprint **Category**: Discovery **Method**: System Information Discovery **Importance**: Low

### Analysis of the Event

The `os_network_fingerprint` detection event indicates an attempt to access multiple directories containing network configuration files on a Linux system, specifically within the `/proc/sys/net` directory structure. This activity is often linked to attempts to gather detailed information about the host's networking capabilities, configurations, and potential vulnerabilities.

The use of file access mechanisms to explore directories such as `/proc/sys/net/core`,`/proc/sys/net/ipv4`, and others suggests an exploration phase where an actor or process seeks to understand the network environment of the host system. This is categorized under Discovery within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, with the specific method being System Information Discovery (T1082). Although marked with low importance, this activity can be a precursor to more invasive actions if sensitive network configurations are exposed or misused.

In the broader context of security frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK, this behavior aligns with techniques involving discovery and reconnaissance within a target's network. This can facilitate further malicious activities such as lateral movement (T1021) or data exfiltration (T1048). Adversaries often use these initial findings to tailor their attack strategies based on the specific environment they are operating in.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity. The detection of such an event during a CI/CD pipeline execution suggests that recent code changes might include scripts or commands interacting with system-level network configurations. If these changes are inadvertently introduced into production environments, they could expose sensitive details about internal networks or even alter network settings in undesirable ways. This could lead to security vulnerabilities where an external attacker might exploit these details to conduct further attacks.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment. During the staging phase, attackers may attempt to gather information about the system's configuration to prepare for a more sophisticated attack in the production environment. This includes identifying potential entry points or weaknesses that can be exploited once the code is deployed.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT). Once an attacker has gained access through network configuration information, they may establish long-term persistence mechanisms to maintain control over the system. This could involve setting up backdoors or using legitimate credentials obtained during the reconnaissance phase for further attacks.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Examine recent commits and changes in the pipeline that might interact with network configurations. Ensure that no unauthorized scripts or commands are accessing network settings.
2. **Implement Code Scanning Tools**: Use static and dynamic analysis tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities in the code that could lead to network configuration exposure.
3. **Enhance Pipeline Security**: Strengthen access controls and monitoring within the CI/CD environment to detect and prevent unauthorized access to network configurations.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct Security Testing**: Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, to identify any weaknesses in network configurations before moving to production.
2. **Monitor for Unauthorized Access**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect any unauthorized attempts to access network configuration files.
3. **Isolate Staging Environment**: Ensure the staging environment is isolated from production to prevent any potential reconnaissance activities from affecting live systems.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Audit Network Configurations**: Regularly audit network settings and configurations to ensure they are secure and have not been altered maliciously.
2. **Implement Incident Response Plan**: Have a robust incident response plan in place to quickly address any detected breaches or unauthorized access attempts.
3. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Regularly review and update security policies to address new threats and ensure compliance with best practices for network security.

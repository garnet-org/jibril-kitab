# Credentials Files Access

## Quick Explanation

The `credentials_files_access` recipe detects access to files that may contain sensitive credentials, such as API keys. Integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, this detection functions as both a preventative and diagnostic tool, ensuring new code changes do not introduce security vulnerabilities. If triggered, it may indicate insecure interactions with sensitive files or the introduction of compromised credentials.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: credentials files access  
**Tactic**: [Credential Access](../../mitre/tactics/TA0006.md)  
**Technique**: [Credentials From Password Stores](../../mitre/techniques/T1555.md)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Credentials From Web Browsers](../../mitre/techniques/T1555.003.md)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The detection event identified by the runtime tracing tool Jibril is designed to monitor and flag unauthorized or suspicious access to files that potentially contain sensitive credentials. This security mechanism is crucial as it helps identify potential breaches or misuse within the system, particularly targeting credential storage locations used by web browsers and other applications. By leveraging file access patterns and specific file paths known to store credentials, Jibril provides an early warning system against attempts to harvest credentials.

The detection logic specifically targets a variety of well-known files and directories commonly used for storing sensitive information such as API keys, Docker configurations, S3 bucket passwords, and browser credential databases. The inclusion of wildcard patterns in the detection mechanism allows Jibril to comprehensively monitor a broad spectrum of file locations potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access attempts.

Given its integration into the CI/CD pipeline, this detection not only serves as a preventative measure but also acts as a diagnostic tool to ensure that new code changes do not inadvertently introduce security weaknesses or exploit existing ones. The use of such detection mechanisms aligns with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) and T1074 (Wireless Access Point Identification), where attackers often seek out sensitive files to gain further access to systems.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

The presence of this detection event within the CI/CD pipeline indicates a proactive approach towards securing application development stages from potential threats posed by credential theft. If such detections are triggered by recent code changes, it could suggest that new updates might be interacting with sensitive files in an insecure manner or that compromised credentials are being introduced into the codebase. Allowing these changes to progress to production environments could lead to significant security breaches, data leaks, or unauthorized access, which could have far-reaching implications on business operations and data privacy.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment are critical concerns in the staging environment. Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in staging environments to gain insights into system configurations and potential weaknesses that can be leveraged for future attacks. This aligns with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques T1089 (Disabling Security Tools) and T1542 (Defeat Logging Mechanisms), where adversaries aim to disable security controls or manipulate logs to evade detection.

#### Implications for Production

In the production environment, long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are significant concerns. Attackers may use compromised credentials obtained from staging environments to gain access to production systems, where they can move laterally across networks and steal sensitive data. This aligns with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques T1098 (Account Manipulation), T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services), and T1567 (Data Encrypted for Impact).

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Changes**: Examine the code changes in the recent commits to identify if new code might be accessing sensitive files. Focus on changes to configuration files, environment variables, or scripts that interact with credential storage.
2. **Enhance Security Review Protocols**: Implement or strengthen code review processes to specifically check for secure handling of credentials. Consider automated tools that can detect potential credential leaks or insecure file access patterns.
3. **Educate Developers**: Conduct training sessions for developers on best practices for handling credentials securely, including the use of environment variables and secure vaults instead of hard-coded values.
4. **Audit and Rotate Credentials**: If a breach is suspected, immediately audit all accessed credentials and rotate them to prevent unauthorized use. Update all affected systems and services with the new credentials.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Perform Security Audits**: Regularly schedule comprehensive security audits in the staging environment to check for vulnerabilities related to credential access. Use automated scanning tools to detect unauthorized access or misconfigurations.
2. **Simulate Attacks**: Conduct controlled penetration testing focusing on credential theft scenarios to evaluate the resilience of the staging environment against such attacks.
3. **Limit Access**: Restrict access to the staging environment to only necessary personnel and automate the monitoring of access logs to detect any unauthorized attempts.
4. **Implement Stronger Access Controls**: Enhance access control mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls, to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive files.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring tools to detect and alert on unauthorized access attempts to sensitive files. Integrate this with an incident response plan that can be triggered automatically.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: If credential access is detected, conduct a forensic analysis to determine the source and extent of the breach. This should include checking access logs, user activity, and network traffic.
3. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Regularly review and update security policies and practices to address new and emerging threats related to credential access. Ensure that these policies are well communicated and understood across the organization.
4. **Incident Response Drills**: Regularly conduct incident response drills to ensure that your team is prepared to act swiftly and effectively in case of a real credential access incident in the production environment.

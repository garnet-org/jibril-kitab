# PAM Config Modification

## Quick Explanation

The `pam_config_modification` recipe identifies unauthorized changes to critical Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) configuration files, which are integral to Linux authentication mechanisms. Such modifications can lead to severe security risks including credential theft, session hijacking, and unauthorized access. In a CI/CD pipeline context, these changes could introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors, thereby compromising the entire infrastructure's integrity and security.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: PAM configuration modification **Category**: Credential Access **Method**: Modify Authentication Process **Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

This detection event, `pam_config_modification`, signifies a high-risk security incident involving unauthorized modifications to critical PAM configuration files located in`/etc/pam.d/` and `/lib/security/`. These directories house sensitive data essential for Linux authentication mechanisms. Attackers often target these configurations to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access.

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) are extensively used across various Linux environments, providing dynamic authentication support for applications and services. Unauthorized changes can lead to significant security breaches such as credential theft, session hijacking, and unauthorized system access. The detection mechanism involves monitoring file actions like modifications within these directories, which is crucial for early identification of malicious activities.

Given the critical importance attributed to this event by Jibril, any detected modification should be treated with urgency and thoroughly investigated. This incident can indicate an ongoing attack or compromise within the system that could undermine the entire authentication framework.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity are significant concerns. Unauthorized modifications in the PAM configuration files during the development phase can introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the software supply chain. These risks can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access once the compromised artifacts reach production environments.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access are potential risks before a deployment reaches production. An attacker could exploit PAM configuration changes in staging environments to perform lateral movement or capture credentials, which can later be used for further attacks on the production environment. Ensuring robust security controls and monitoring during this phase is critical.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are significant concerns in a production setting. Unauthorized modifications to PAM configurations can allow attackers to maintain long-term access to systems, enabling them to perform various malicious activities undetected over extended periods.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Review recent changes in the CI/CD pipeline to identify any unauthorized modifications to PAM configuration files. Check commit histories, build scripts, and deployment logs for anomalies.
2. **Access Control Review**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to modify PAM configurations. Implement strict access controls and use role-based access management.
3. **Pipeline Security Enhancement**: Integrate security checks within the CI/CD pipeline to detect unauthorized changes to critical files. Use automated tools to monitor and alert on such modifications.
4. **Incident Response Plan**: Prepare and test an incident response plan specifically for CI/CD environments to quickly address any detected unauthorized changes.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Configuration Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of PAM configuration files in the staging environment to detect unauthorized changes. Compare with known good configurations from version control.
2. **Security Testing**: Perform security testing, including penetration testing, to identify potential vulnerabilities introduced by unauthorized PAM modifications.
3. **Access Restrictions**: Limit access to the staging environment to essential personnel only and ensure that all actions are logged and reviewed regularly.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Containment**: If unauthorized changes are detected, immediately contain the incident by isolating affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the modifications. Identify the source of the breach and any compromised credentials.
3. **Restore and Harden**: Restore PAM configurations from a known good backup and harden the system against future attacks. This may include patching vulnerabilities and updating security policies.

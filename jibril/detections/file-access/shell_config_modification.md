# Shell Config Modification

## Quick Explanation

The `shell_config_modification` recipe identifies changes to critical shell configuration files, which are vital for defining shell session environments. These modifications often indicate defense evasion tactics where attackers alter authentication processes to bypass security measures, potentially leading to privilege escalation or persistent unauthorized access. In a CI/CD context, such changes could introduce backdoors or malicious code into the build process, risking server compromise and data theft.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Shell configuration file modification  
**Tactic**: [Defense Evasion](../../mitre/tactics/TA0005.md)  
**Technique**: [Modify Authentication Process](../../mitre/techniques/T1556.md)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Pluggable Authentication Modules](../../mitre/techniques/T1556.003.md)  
**Importance**: Medium to High

### Analysis of the Event

The detection event named `shell_config_modification` is designed to identify unauthorized or suspicious modifications to critical shell configuration files across various user and system profiles. These files, such as `.bashrc`, `.profile`, and `/etc/profile`, are crucial in defining the environment settings for shell sessions and can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or maintain unauthorized access.

This type of activity is commonly associated with defense evasion tactics where an attacker subtly modifies authentication processes to bypass security mechanisms. By altering shell configurations, malicious actors can insert scripts that activate upon user login, potentially leading to further exploitation or data exfiltration. The MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorizes such activities under T1036 (Masquerading) and T1548 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), highlighting the importance of monitoring these modifications as part of a comprehensive security strategy.

Given the broad scope of files monitored — from user-specific files like `.bashrc` to system-wide configurations like `/etc/profile` — this detection mechanism is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of Unix/Linux-based systems within a CI/CD pipeline. Attackers often leverage such vulnerabilities through supply chain attacks, where they compromise dependencies or build artifacts to inject malicious code.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity are significant in this context. Adversaries might exploit modifications to shell configuration files during the build phase to introduce backdoors or other malicious payloads that can be propagated across environments unnoticed. This could lead to server compromise and data theft if not detected early.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks are heightened in staging environments before production deployment. Attackers may use this stage to test the effectiveness of their modifications or exfiltrate sensitive information without being noticed by security systems that are less stringent compared to production monitoring.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are prevalent in production environments. Once shell configurations are compromised, attackers can use these footholds for long-term access, move laterally within the network, steal credentials, or exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected by standard security measures.

### Recommended Actions

For the recipe `shell_config_modification`:

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Changes**: Immediately review recent changes to shell configuration files in your CI/CD environment. Look for unauthorized modifications or scripts that could indicate a compromise.
2. **Audit Build Processes**: Conduct a thorough audit of your build processes and dependencies to ensure no malicious code has been introduced. Verify the integrity of all build artifacts.
3. **Strengthen Access Controls**: Ensure that access to modify shell configuration files is restricted to authorized personnel only. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct Security Testing**: Perform security testing on the staging environment to identify any unauthorized changes to shell configurations and assess potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Analyze access logs to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access to shell configuration files.
3. **Isolate Environment**: Consider isolating the staging environment from production to prevent potential threats from propagating.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Launch an immediate investigation into any detected modifications to shell configuration files. Identify the source and scope of the compromise.
2. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Perform a forensic analysis to understand the extent of the attack, including potential lateral movement and data exfiltration.
3. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched and updated to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations.

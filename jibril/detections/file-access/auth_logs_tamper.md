# Auth Logs Tamper

## Quick Explanation

The `auth_logs_tamper` detection recipe identifies suspicious file operations such as removal or truncation of critical system authentication logs. These actions may indicate attempts to conceal malicious activity, making it harder for defenders to detect intrusions and understand the timeline of events.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Authentication logs tampering  
**Tactic**: [Defense Evasion](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005)  
**Technique**: [Indicator Removal](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005/t1070)  
**Sub-Technique**: [File Deletion](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005/t1070/t1070.004)  
**Importance**: High

### Analysis of the Event

The `auth_logs_tamper` detection event, as identified by Jibril, triggers when file removal or truncation operations are performed on key authentication and logging files. These actions can be indicative of an adversary attempting to obscure their presence within a system. Logs such as `/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/wtmp`, and `/var/log/btmp` are critical for maintaining audit trails that help in identifying unauthorized access, privilege escalation attempts, or other malicious activities.

From the perspective of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, this event aligns with techniques categorized under **Defense Evasion**. Specifically, it falls under the subcategory of "Indicator Removal on Host," where adversaries remove or manipulate forensic evidence to avoid detection. In a CI/CD pipeline context, log tampering can be particularly dangerous as it can mask unauthorized changes or malicious code introduced during build processes. By eliminating or corrupting logs, attackers can remain undetected and potentially persist within systems or applications, complicating forensic investigations.

At a deeper level, removing or truncating authentication logs not only invalidates critical forensics data but also disrupts normal auditing procedures. This tactic is often combined with other methods such as lateral movement (T1021) or privilege escalation (T1055), allowing attackers to quietly expand their foothold within the environment while remaining under the radar of standard security monitoring tools.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

In the context of CI/CD pipelines, the detection of authentication logs tampering raises significant concerns about the integrity of the build and deployment processes. If left unaddressed, this event could indicate that an attacker has gained unauthorized access to the pipeline and is attempting to conceal their activities by removing or altering critical logs. This could lead to the deployment of malicious code into production environments, potentially resulting in data breaches, service disruptions, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, authentication logs tampering can have serious implications for the security of the deployment pipeline. Adversaries may exploit this tactic to cover their tracks and maintain persistence within the environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of production systems. Detecting and responding to log tampering in staging environments is crucial to prevent the escalation of attacks and protect the integrity of the deployment process.

#### Implications for Production

In production environments, the tampering of authentication logs poses a significant risk to the security and availability of critical systems. By removing or truncating these logs, attackers can evade detection, cover their tracks, and maintain persistent access to sensitive resources. This can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities that could have severe consequences for the organization. Detecting and responding to log tampering in production environments is essential to prevent further compromise and protect critical assets.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Audit and Review**: Immediately audit all recent changes and deployments to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activity. Review the integrity of the codebase and check for any unauthorized modifications or additions.
2. **Access Control**: Review and tighten access controls around the CI/CD pipeline. Ensure that only authorized personnel have the ability to make changes to the pipeline and related systems.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: If tampering is confirmed, conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach and identify the methods used by the attacker. This will help in strengthening the defenses against future attacks.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the staging environment from other network segments to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Comprehensive Scan**: Perform a comprehensive security scan of the staging environment to check for any signs of compromise or residual malicious activity.
3. **Restore Logs**: Restore the tampered logs from backups, if available, to regain visibility into recent activities and help in the investigation process.
4. **Security Review**: Conduct a security review of the staging environment setup, focusing on access controls, monitoring capabilities, and incident response procedures.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Incident Response Activation**: Activate the incident response plan and assemble the response team to address the detected tampering event.
2. **Log Analysis**: Utilize backup logs or any existing forensic data to analyze the activities prior to the tampering incident. This can provide insights into the attackerâ€™s actions and objectives.
3. **System-Wide Audit**: Conduct a system-wide audit to check for any further signs of compromise, unauthorized access, or other anomalies in the production environment.
4. **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed about the situation and the steps being taken to resolve the issue, maintaining transparency and trust.

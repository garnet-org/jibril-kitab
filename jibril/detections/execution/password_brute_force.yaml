# Password Brute Force

## Quick Explanation

The `password_brute_force` recipe detects the execution of tools commonly used for brute-force password guessing. These tools systematically attempt numerous password combinations to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts, posing significant security risks.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Password brute-force tool execution  
**Tactic**: [Credential Access](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0006)    
**Technique**: [Brute Force](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0006/t1110)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Password Guessing](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0006/t1110/t1110.001)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

This detection event identifies the execution of known brute-force password guessing tools such as Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat, and others. These tools automate the process of systematically guessing passwords by iterating through large lists of potential passwords or generating combinations algorithmically.

According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this activity falls under Credential Access, specifically the Brute Force technique (T1110) and the Password Guessing sub-technique (T1110.001). Such activities are critical indicators of potential unauthorized access attempts and can lead to compromised accounts, privilege escalation, and further exploitation.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

The execution of password brute-force tools within CI/CD pipelines indicates a severe risk of unauthorized access attempts targeting sensitive credentials or authentication mechanisms. Attackers may attempt to compromise pipeline credentials, leading to unauthorized code injection, build process compromise, or dependency poisoning. This can result in malicious artifacts being deployed into staging or production environments.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, the use of brute-force password guessing tools suggests adversarial reconnaissance or attempts to gain unauthorized access. Attackers may leverage compromised credentials to escalate privileges, exfiltrate sensitive data, or establish persistent access. Such activities pose significant risks related to insider threats, unauthorized access, and potential data leakage.

#### Implications for Production

In production environments, brute-force password guessing attempts represent critical threats, including credential theft, lateral movement, and long-term persistence. Successful brute-force attacks can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems, data exfiltration, and potential compromise by advanced persistent threats (APTs). The impact of such breaches can be severe, affecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Immediate Credential Audit**: Review and audit all pipeline credentials and authentication mechanisms to identify potential compromise or unauthorized access attempts.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement or enhance monitoring solutions to detect and alert on brute-force attempts targeting pipeline credentials or authentication endpoints.
3. **Strengthen Authentication Controls**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies for all pipeline-related accounts and services.
4. **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities related to credential management and authentication.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Investigate Unauthorized Access Attempts**: Immediately investigate any detected brute-force attempts to determine the scope and potential impact of unauthorized access.
2. **Implement Access Controls**: Strengthen access controls and enforce multi-factor authentication to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials.
3. **Environment Isolation**: Ensure staging environments are isolated from production and sensitive resources to limit potential damage from compromised credentials.
4. **Regular Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotate credentials and enforce strong password policies to reduce the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Activate Incident Response**: Immediately activate incident response procedures to investigate, contain, and remediate any potential breaches resulting from brute-force password guessing attempts.
2. **Continuous Security Monitoring**: Deploy continuous monitoring solutions to detect and alert on suspicious authentication attempts, enabling rapid response and mitigation.
3. **Credential Management and Rotation**: Implement robust credential management practices, including regular rotation, multi-factor authentication, and least-privilege access controls to minimize the risk of credential compromise.
4. **Security Awareness and Training**: Provide ongoing security awareness training to educate users on recognizing and preventing brute-force attacks and credential compromise.

# Passwd Usage

## Quick Explanation

The `passwd_usage` recipe identifies the use of password management commands within the CI/CD pipeline, signaling potential credential access attempts through OS credential dumping. These commands include `passwd`, `chpasswd`, `usermod`, and others, which are generally used for legitimate administrative tasks but can be exploited by malicious actors to escalate privileges or manipulate user accounts. If not addressed, such activities could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of interconnected systems.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Password related command usage  
**Tactic**: [Credential Access](../../mitre/tactics/TA0006.md)  
**Technique**: [OS Credential Dumping](../../mitre/techniques/T1003.md)  
**Importance**: Medium

### Analysis of the Event

The detection event identified the use of commands related to password management, such as`passwd`, `chpasswd`, and `usermod`, within the CI/CD pipeline. This detection falls under the category of credential access and employs the method of OS credential dumping, indicating an attempt to access or modify system credentials.

Using the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, this event aligns with techniques used by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to credentials stored on a system. The commands listed are typically used for legitimate administrative purposes but can also be exploited by malicious actors to escalate privileges or pivot within a network. For example, an adversary might use these commands to change passwords of existing user accounts or create new ones with elevated permissions.

The presence of these commands in a CI/CD pipeline could signify an attempt to manipulate user accounts or elevate privileges during the build or deployment process. This is particularly concerning as it suggests that recent changes in the pull request might include code that attempts to perform unauthorized actions on user accounts, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and further compromise.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

In the context of CI/CD pipelines, risks related to build process compromise are significant. Malicious actors can inject malicious code or manipulate dependencies during the build phase, which could then be deployed into production environments. Dependency poisoning is another critical risk where adversaries may introduce compromised packages that contain malicious payloads.

#### Implications for Staging

During adversarial testing in staging environments, data leakage and insider threats become more pronounced risks before production deployment. Unauthorized access can lead to sensitive information being exfiltrated or manipulated, compromising the integrity of the system prior to full-scale deployment.

#### Implications for Production

In production environments, long-term persistence risks are heightened due to the potential for attackers to maintain a foothold within the network through compromised credentials and elevated privileges. Lateral movement becomes easier as adversaries can use stolen credentials to access other systems and services, leading to credential theft and data exfiltration. Advanced persistent threats (APT) may leverage these compromised credentials to establish backdoors or covert channels, allowing for prolonged and undetected presence within the network.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Immediately review recent changes in the pipeline, especially those related to user account management. Look for any unauthorized scripts or code snippets that might be attempting to manipulate user credentials.
2. **Audit Pipeline Permissions**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to modify the pipeline configuration. Limit the use of sensitive commands like `passwd`,`chpasswd`, and `usermod` to trusted scripts and personnel.
3. **Conduct a Security Review**: Perform a thorough security review of the pipeline to identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited by malicious actors.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Isolate and Investigate**: Isolate the staging environment to prevent potential leaks or unauthorized access. Investigate any suspicious activities related to credential management.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Examine access logs for unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts. Pay attention to any changes in user accounts or permissions.
3. **Strengthen Access Controls**: Enhance access controls and ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive areas of the staging environment.
4. **Test for Vulnerabilities**: Conduct penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities that could be exploited during the staging process.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Response Plan**: Activate an incident response plan to address potential compromises. This includes isolating affected systems and conducting a thorough investigation.
2. **Credential Rotation**: Rotate credentials for affected systems and accounts to prevent unauthorized access. Ensure that new credentials are stored securely.
3. **Review and Harden Security Posture**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the security posture of the production environment. Implement additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication and network segmentation to reduce the risk of future incidents.

# Runc Suspicious Exec

## Quick Explanation

The `runc_suspicious_exec` detection recipe identifies instances where the `runc` binary is executed by an unknown or unexpected process, which can be indicative of a potential threat. This event could lead to unauthorized access or control over containerized environments, posing significant risks to the CI/CD pipeline and potentially allowing attackers to leverage these environments for further malicious activities.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: `runc` binary executed by a suspicious process **Category**: Defense Evasion **Method**: Masquerading **Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

This detection indicates that the `runc` binary was executed by an unknown or unexpected process, which is flagged as suspicious because `runc`, typically invoked by recognized container runtime managers such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O. The execution of `runc` by an unauthorized process could suggest a sophisticated attack vector where adversaries are attempting to masquerade their malicious activities as legitimate operations.

This event aligns with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the Defense Evasion category and employs techniques such as T1036 (Masquerading) and T1218 (Supply Chain Compromise). Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain to introduce backdoors or malicious code that can be triggered later, leading to unauthorized execution of `runc`.

The critical importance of this detection underscores the potential for significant security breaches. Attackers could leverage such events to gain persistent access within containerized environments, deploy additional malware, and perform lateral movement across network segments.

### Implications

### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

In the context of CI/CD pipelines, the execution of `runc` by an unknown process poses severe risks related to build process compromise. Adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in dependencies or introduce malicious artifacts through dependency poisoning. This could result in unauthorized access during the build phase and lead to the deployment of compromised container images.

### Implications for Staging

During the staging phase, adversarial testing can be conducted where attackers attempt to exfiltrate data or perform reconnaissance activities without detection. Risks include insider threats and unauthorized access that can compromise sensitive information before production deployment.

### Implications for Production

In a production environment, long-term persistence risks are heightened as attackers may establish backdoors within containerized environments. Lateral movement techniques can be used to spread the attack across different services, while credential theft and data exfiltration become more feasible. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) groups often leverage such vulnerabilities for sustained operations.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Investigate the Source**: Immediately review the logs and trace back the source of the unexpected `runc` execution. Identify any recent changes or deployments that might have introduced unauthorized processes.
2. **Review Dependencies**: Conduct a thorough audit of all dependencies and third-party libraries used in the pipeline to ensure no malicious code has been introduced.
3. **Enhance Security Measures**: Implement stricter access controls and authentication mechanisms for the CI/CD environment to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct Security Testing**: Perform comprehensive security testing to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers during the staging phase.
2. **Limit Access**: Restrict access to the staging environment to only essential personnel and processes, minimizing the risk of insider threats.
3. **Data Protection**: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted and that data access is logged and monitored for any unauthorized attempts.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**: If suspicious activity is detected, isolate the affected systems to prevent further spread of potential threats.
2. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems and containers are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
3. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Perform a thorough security audit to identify and close any gaps that could be exploited by attackers.
4. **Incident Response Plan**: Review and update the incident response plan to ensure quick and effective action can be taken in the event of a security breach.

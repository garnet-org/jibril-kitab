# File Attribute Change

## Event: file\_attribute\_change

### Quick Explanation

The `file_attribute_change` recipe identifies modifications to file attributes, a tactic often used by attackers to conceal malicious activities. By altering file permissions, timestamps, or ownership, adversaries can evade detection and maintain persistence within the system.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: File attributes change **Category**: Defense Evasion **Method**: Hide Artifacts **Importance**: High

### Analysis of the Event

The `file_attribute_change` detection event monitors and alerts on modifications to file attributes within the system. It falls under the 'Defense Evasion' category, focusing on identifying attempts to bypass security measures as defined by the MITRE ATT\&CK framework.

Specifically, this event targets changes in file attributes that could be used to conceal malicious activities or artifacts within the system. This is categorized as T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host) and T1562 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools), both of which are tactics employed by adversaries to evade detection.

Alterations to file attributes, including permissions, timestamps, and ownership, can be exploited by attackers to hide their presence on a system. For instance, an attacker might change the last modified timestamp of a file to blend in with legitimate activity or modify file permissions to prevent detection by security tools.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

In a CI/CD pipeline, this detection event can have serious implications if not addressed promptly. Undetected changes in file attributes related to a pull request could result in malicious code being merged into the main codebase and deployed into production environments. This could lead to security breaches, data leaks, or even complete system compromise.

For example, an attacker might exploit dependency poisoning by modifying the attributes of a package file to bypass signature verification checks during the build process (T1036: Masquerading). Additionally, changes in file permissions can enable unauthorized access to sensitive information or allow for persistent backdoors into the system (T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter).

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, adversarial testing could involve attempts to exploit vulnerabilities through modified file attributes. For instance, an attacker might alter the attributes of a configuration file to bypass security controls during the deployment phase.

Moreover, insider threats or unauthorized access risks become heightened as attackers may use these techniques to gain elevated privileges or maintain persistence before production deployment (T1098: Account Manipulation).

#### Implications for Production

In production environments, long-term persistence risks increase significantly due to undetected changes in file attributes. Attackers might exploit this by altering the permissions of critical files to enable lateral movement within the network or steal credentials for further compromise.

Advanced persistent threats (APT) often use these techniques as part of their lifecycle to remain undetected over extended periods, making it essential to monitor and detect any suspicious attribute changes that could indicate ongoing malicious activity (T1074: Data Stolen).

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review and Audit Pull Requests**: Implement strict code review and auditing processes for any changes made to file attributes within the repository. Ensure that all changes are justified and documented.
2. **Implement File Integrity Monitoring**: Use file integrity monitoring tools to track and alert on unauthorized changes to file attributes throughout the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **Educate Developers**: Conduct training sessions for developers on the security risks associated with file attribute changes and the importance of adhering to best practices for secure coding.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct Thorough Testing**: Perform rigorous security testing in the staging environment to detect any unauthorized or suspicious changes in file attributes.
2. **Use Configuration Management Tools**: Implement configuration management tools to enforce and restore file attributes to their expected states automatically.
3. **Limit Access Controls**: Restrict access to modify file attributes only to authorized personnel and automate the enforcement of these permissions.
4. **Regularly Update Security Policies**: Regularly review and update security policies and procedures to include checks for unauthorized file attribute changes.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan that includes specific procedures for investigating and mitigating unauthorized changes in file attributes.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: In case of a security incident, conduct a forensic analysis to determine the root cause and extent of impact due to the change in file attributes.
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule regular security audits to assess the effectiveness of the controls in place and identify any potential gaps that need to be addressed.

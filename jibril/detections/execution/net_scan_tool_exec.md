# Net Scan Tool Exec

## Quick Explanation

The `net_scan_tool_exec` recipe identifies the execution of network scanning tools used for discovering network services and open ports. This detection is critical as it indicates potential reconnaissance activities that could lead to identifying vulnerabilities for exploitation. The presence of such tools in pull requests poses significant risks to CI/CD pipelines and production systems, including unauthorized scans that can expose sensitive infrastructure information.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Network scan tool **Category**: Discovery **Method**: Network Service Scanning **Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

This detection event identifies the execution of a network scanning tool within the monitored environment. Tools such as `nmap`, `masscan`, and `zenmap` are often used for discovering network services, open ports, and other critical information that can be leveraged for further exploitation or reconnaissance activities.

The MITRE ATT\&CK framework classifies this activity under the Discovery category with the method being Network Service Scanning. This indicates an attempt to map out the network structure or identify active services, which could precede more targeted attacks. Attackers often use these tools to gather information on reachable hosts and open ports, enabling them to craft tailored exploits based on known vulnerabilities associated with specific software versions.

The detection mechanism relies on monitoring specific file executions using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and other tracing techniques provided by Jibril. These methods allow for real-time analysis of system calls that are characteristic of network scanning activities. This level of visibility is crucial for identifying both legitimate and malicious usage patterns, particularly in environments where such tools may be used legitimately but require strict controls.

The implications of such detections are significant as they point towards potential reconnaissance activities within your environment. Unauthorized entities performing these scans can identify vulnerabilities that may be exploited later. Even if conducted by internal actors, it might indicate non-compliance with security policies or unintended security risks. Historical attack patterns show that attackers often use network scanning tools to perform initial reconnaissance before moving on to more sophisticated attacks such as lateral movement and data exfiltration.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity include unauthorized scans that can expose sensitive infrastructure information. Attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious dependencies or modifying build artifacts, leading to compromised production environments.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment are heightened when network scanning tools are present in staging environments. These risks include the potential for internal actors to misuse their privileges, leading to data breaches or other security incidents that could compromise sensitive information prior to full-scale deployment.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are significantly increased in production environments where network scanning tools have been detected. Attackers can use this reconnaissance phase to establish a foothold within the network, move laterally across systems, steal credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Audit and Review**: Immediately audit the logs and artifacts related to the detected network scan tool execution. Identify the source and review the changes made in the pull request or during the build process that led to this execution.
2. **Security Training**: Conduct security training for developers to reinforce the importance of secure coding practices and the risks associated with unauthorized tool usage in the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **Update Security Policies**: Review and update security policies to include explicit guidelines on the use of network scanning tools and the consequences of non-compliance.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Perform a thorough security audit of the staging environment to check for any anomalies or unauthorized changes that could have been introduced by the network scanning tool.
2. **Restrict Tool Usage**: Implement strict access controls and usage policies for network scanning tools in the staging environment to prevent misuse by internal actors.
3. **Simulate Attack Scenarios**: Run controlled attack simulations to understand potential vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of current security measures.
4. **Review Access Logs**: Regularly review access logs and patterns to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities that could indicate insider threats or data leakage.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate any systems where the network scanning tool was executed to prevent any potential lateral movement or further unauthorized activities.
2. **Incident Response**: Activate the incident response team to assess the scope of the potential breach or unauthorized access, and to implement containment and mitigation strategies.
3. **Review and Harden Security Posture**: Review the overall security posture of the production environment and harden defenses by updating firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and implementing stricter access controls.

## Introduction

SEO Poisoning (T1608.006) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under Stage Capabilities (T1608). It involves manipulating search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to direct users toward malicious websites or compromised content. Attackers exploit commonly searched keywords, trending topics, or popular events to increase the visibility of malicious content in search engine results, thereby deceiving users into visiting attacker-controlled or compromised websites.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

SEO Poisoning leverages legitimate SEO practices to artificially inflate the ranking of malicious websites or pages, making them appear prominently in search engine results. Attackers typically execute SEO Poisoning through the following methods:

- **Keyword Stuffing:**
  - Injecting excessive keywords into web pages or metadata to artificially boost rankings.
  - Often hidden from users through CSS techniques, small fonts, or matching text color to the background.
- **Link Farms and Backlink Manipulation:**
  - Creating networks of interconnected websites or blogs that link back to malicious pages.
  - Exploiting legitimate websites through comment spam, forum posts, or guestbook entries containing backlinks.
- **Content Hijacking and Cloaking:**
  - Scraping legitimate content from reputable websites and embedding malicious scripts or redirects.
  - Cloaking techniques serving benign content to search engine crawlers while delivering malicious payloads to actual visitors.
- **Trending Topic Exploitation:**
  - Rapidly creating malicious content around trending topics, breaking news, or high-profile events to attract a large audience.
  - Utilizing automated tools and scripts to mass-generate pages quickly.
- **Compromised Legitimate Websites:**
  - Gaining unauthorized access to legitimate websites to insert malicious SEO content or redirects.
  - Leveraging the reputation and trust of established domains to evade suspicion.

Attackers commonly combine these methods for maximum effectiveness, continuously adapting their strategy based on search engine algorithm changes and current events.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

SEO Poisoning typically appears in the following attack scenarios and stages:

- **Initial Access Stage:**
  - Used as a primary vector for delivering malware, phishing pages, or scams.
  - Attracting unsuspecting users through search engines to malicious landing pages.
- **Credential Harvesting Campaigns:**
  - Directing users to fake login portals or phishing pages designed to steal credentials.
  - Commonly targeting popular services (email, social media, banking).
- **Malware Distribution:**
  - Linking users to compromised websites hosting exploit kits, trojans, ransomware, or other malware payloads.
  - Often combined with drive-by download attacks.
- **Disinformation and Influence Operations:**
  - Promoting fake news, propaganda, or misinformation campaigns.
  - Manipulating public opinion or perception around sensitive topics or events.
- **Financial Fraud and Scams:**
  - Redirecting users to fraudulent investment schemes, fake online stores, or cryptocurrency scams.
  - Exploiting trending financial topics or products to attract attention.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of SEO Poisoning involves proactive monitoring, analysis, and response strategies, including:

- **Web Traffic Analysis:**
  - Monitoring unusual spikes in traffic, especially from search engine referrals.
  - Identifying abnormal user-agent strings or referrer headers indicative of malicious crawlers or bots.
- **Content and Website Integrity Monitoring:**
  - Implementing automated tools to detect unauthorized changes to website content, metadata, or code.
  - Regularly auditing website structure, links, and embedded scripts for malicious modifications.
- **Search Engine Result Monitoring:**
  - Periodically checking search engine results for brand-related keywords or trending topics to identify unauthorized or suspicious listings.
  - Utilizing SEO monitoring tools to detect sudden ranking changes or new backlinks from suspicious domains.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**
  - Correlating logs from web servers, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint security solutions to identify malicious activity.
  - Alerting on unusual patterns of scanning, content scraping, or automated bot traffic.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Presence of hidden keywords or links within website source code.
  - Sudden increase in backlinks from unrelated or suspicious domains.
  - Detection of cloaking techniques (user-agent detection, IP-based redirects).
  - Malicious JavaScript or iframe injections redirecting users to unknown domains.
  - Suspicious domain registrations closely resembling legitimate websites or brands.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection and mitigation of SEO Poisoning is critical due to the following potential impacts and risks:

- **Reputational Damage:**
  - Association of legitimate brands and websites with malicious or fraudulent content.
  - Loss of user trust and credibility, negatively affecting customer confidence and business relationships.
- **Financial Losses:**
  - Users falling victim to scams, phishing attacks, or malware infections facilitated by SEO Poisoning.
  - Businesses facing legal liabilities, regulatory fines, or remediation costs due to compromised websites.
- **Security Risks:**
  - Facilitating the spread of malware, ransomware, or spyware infections across user devices and networks.
  - Increased exposure to credential theft, account compromise, and unauthorized access.
- **Operational Disruption:**
  - Resources diverted to incident response, remediation efforts, and recovery from SEO Poisoning incidents.
  - Potential blacklisting by search engines, resulting in reduced visibility and loss of traffic.
- **Propagation of Misinformation:**
  - Amplifying false narratives, propaganda, or disinformation campaigns, potentially causing societal harm or public panic.

Detecting SEO Poisoning early helps organizations minimize these impacts, maintain user trust, and protect their digital assets and reputation.

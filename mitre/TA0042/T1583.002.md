# DNS Server

## Information

- Name: DNS Server
- ID: T1583.002
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1583](T1583.md)

## Introduction

DNS Server ([T1583.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/002/)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the parent technique "Acquire Infrastructure" (T1583). This tactic involves adversaries establishing or compromising Domain Name System (DNS) servers to facilitate malicious activities. DNS servers are crucial infrastructure components responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses, making them a strategic target for attackers. By controlling DNS infrastructure, attackers can effectively redirect user traffic, conduct phishing campaigns, distribute malware, or maintain persistent access to compromised environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The DNS Server sub-technique involves adversaries either compromising existing DNS servers or creating their own malicious DNS infrastructure. Attackers leverage DNS servers to:

- Redirect legitimate user traffic to malicious sites (DNS hijacking).
- Host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure for malware operations.
- Facilitate phishing attacks by resolving legitimate-seeming domains to attacker-controlled servers.
- Execute DNS tunneling to exfiltrate sensitive data or communicate covertly.
- Conduct domain generation algorithm (DGA) operations to dynamically generate domains that evade detection.

Technical execution methods include:

- **DNS Hijacking:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to DNS records, altering them to redirect traffic to malicious IP addresses.
- **DNS Tunneling:** Encapsulating non-DNS traffic within DNS queries and responses, allowing covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
- **Malicious DNS Server Creation:** Attackers set up their own authoritative DNS servers, registering malicious domains to support phishing, malware distribution, or C2 infrastructure.
- **DNS Cache Poisoning:** Injecting fraudulent DNS entries into DNS caches, causing users to be redirected to attacker-controlled resources.

Real-world procedural details:

- Attackers commonly use stolen credentials, vulnerabilities in DNS management portals, or exploit DNS server software vulnerabilities to compromise DNS infrastructure.
- DNS tunneling often leverages encoded or encrypted payloads embedded within DNS queries and responses, complicating detection.
- Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups frequently utilize DNS infrastructure to maintain persistence and covert communication channels.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ DNS Server sub-technique across multiple attack stages and scenarios, including:

- **Initial Access & Phishing:** Redirecting users to fraudulent login pages or malicious download sites.
- **Command-and-Control (C2):** Using DNS tunneling or malicious DNS servers to communicate covertly with infected hosts.
- **Persistence & Evasion:** Establishing resilient infrastructure that is difficult to identify, block, or remove.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Leveraging DNS tunneling to bypass traditional perimeter defenses and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Reconnaissance & Intelligence Gathering:** Redirecting traffic to attacker-controlled servers to monitor user behavior and collect sensitive information.

Common scenarios include:

- State-sponsored cyber espionage campaigns.
- Financially motivated cybercriminal operations targeting financial institutions or e-commerce platforms.
- Malware campaigns utilizing DNS-based command-and-control infrastructure.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of DNS Server sub-technique involves multiple methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Network Monitoring & Analysis:**
  - Monitoring DNS query volume and frequency to identify unusual spikes or patterns indicative of DNS tunneling.
  - Analyzing DNS traffic logs for queries containing large payloads, abnormal subdomains, or encoded/encrypted data.
- **DNS Traffic Inspection:**
  - Using tools such as Zeek (formerly Bro), Suricata, or Snort to detect anomalous DNS traffic patterns.
  - Implementing security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to correlate DNS logs with threat intelligence feeds.
- **Threat Intelligence & IoC Integration:**
  - Leveraging threat intelligence databases to identify known malicious domains and DNS server IP addresses.
  - Monitoring newly registered domains, especially those with suspicious naming patterns or short-lived registrations.
- **Behavioral Analysis & Machine Learning:**
  - Employing anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from baseline DNS traffic behavior.
  - Using machine learning-based threat detection platforms to detect DNS tunneling or hijacking attempts.
- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Suspicious DNS queries with unusual lengths, character sets, or encoding methods.
  - Unexpected DNS record changes or unauthorized modifications in DNS management interfaces.
  - DNS requests to known malicious or newly registered domains.
  - High volume of failed DNS queries or NXDOMAIN responses indicating potential DGA activity.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of DNS Server sub-technique is critical due to several potential impacts and risks:

- **Data Theft & Exfiltration:** Attackers can covertly exfiltrate sensitive data through DNS tunneling, bypassing traditional security controls.
- **Credential Harvesting & Phishing:** DNS hijacking facilitates convincing phishing attacks, leading to credential compromise and account takeover.
- **Persistent Access & C2 Infrastructure:** Attackers maintaining DNS infrastructure can ensure persistent and resilient command-and-control channels, complicating remediation efforts.
- **Service Disruption & Reputation Damage:** DNS infrastructure compromise can result in service outages, loss of customer trust, and significant reputational harm.
- **Detection Difficulty & Evasion:** DNS-based attack techniques are often overlooked or underestimated, allowing attackers to evade detection for extended periods.

Detecting this technique early enables organizations to:

- Prevent data breaches and reduce the potential impact of data loss.
- Mitigate phishing and credential theft risks proactively.
- Limit attacker persistence and minimize dwell time within networks.
- Safeguard organizational reputation and maintain customer trust.

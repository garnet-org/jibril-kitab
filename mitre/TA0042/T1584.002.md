# DNS Server

## Information

- Name: DNS Server
- ID: T1584.002
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1584](T1584.md)

## Introduction

DNS Server \[T1584.002] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under the parent technique "Compromise Infrastructure" (T1584). It involves adversaries compromising or taking control of Domain Name System (DNS) servers to manipulate DNS records, redirect user traffic, facilitate command-and-control (C2) communications, or intercept sensitive information. By controlling DNS infrastructure, attackers can discreetly redirect legitimate traffic to malicious servers or services, making this sub-technique particularly effective for stealthy and persistent operations.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employing DNS Server \[T1584.002] typically begin by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within DNS infrastructure. Common methods include:

- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Attackers target known or zero-day vulnerabilities in DNS software such as BIND, Microsoft DNS Server, or DNS management platforms.
- **Credential Theft and Reuse**: Adversaries may compromise administrator credentials through phishing, credential dumping, or brute-force attacks to gain privileged access and alter DNS records.
- **DNS Hijacking**: Attackers alter authoritative DNS records, causing legitimate domain names to resolve to attacker-controlled IP addresses.
- **DNS Cache Poisoning**: Attackers inject false DNS responses into DNS resolver caches, leading users to malicious sites without needing direct control over authoritative DNS servers.
- **Domain Registrar Compromise**: Attackers compromise domain registrar accounts to change DNS delegation settings, redirecting authoritative DNS requests to attacker-controlled infrastructure.

Once compromised, adversaries commonly perform:

- **Traffic Redirection**: Redirecting legitimate user traffic to malicious sites or phishing pages.
- **Credential Harvesting**: Capturing user credentials or sensitive information through spoofed services and login pages.
- **Establishing C2 Channels**: Using compromised DNS infrastructure to create covert communication channels between attacker-controlled servers and malware-infected hosts.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Leveraging DNS tunneling techniques to exfiltrate sensitive data undetected.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

DNS Server compromise typically appears at various stages and scenarios in cyber-attacks, including:

- **Initial Access and Reconnaissance**: Attackers might initially compromise DNS servers to redirect targets to malicious sites, facilitating initial infection or reconnaissance.
- **Persistence and Command-and-Control**: After gaining initial footholds, adversaries use compromised DNS infrastructure to maintain persistent access and establish stealthy C2 channels.
- **Credential Harvesting Operations**: Attackers redirect legitimate authentication services to phishing sites to steal credentials.
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Attackers compromise DNS infrastructure of trusted third-party vendors or service providers to indirectly target downstream customers.
- **Cyber Espionage Campaigns**: Nation-state actors manipulate DNS infrastructure to intercept sensitive communications or redirect targets to surveillance infrastructure.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of DNS Server compromise typically involves:

- **Monitoring DNS Record Changes**:
  - Implementing automated monitoring and alerting for unexpected or unauthorized DNS record modifications.
  - Regular baseline comparisons of DNS records to quickly identify suspicious alterations.
- **Analyzing DNS Traffic Patterns**:
  - Inspecting DNS query logs for abnormal volumes of traffic or unusual query patterns indicative of DNS tunneling or C2 activity.
  - Identifying DNS queries resolving to suspicious or previously unseen IP addresses, especially those associated with known malicious infrastructure.
- **Network Security Monitoring**:
  - Deploying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to detect anomalous network traffic patterns consistent with DNS hijacking or cache poisoning.
  - Using threat intelligence feeds to correlate DNS requests and resolutions with known malicious domains or IP addresses.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  - EDR solutions detecting malware attempts to alter local DNS resolver configurations or DNS cache poisoning attempts at the endpoint level.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Unauthorized DNS record changes (A, MX, NS, CNAME records).
  - Unexpected DNS resolutions pointing to unusual geographical locations or IP blocks.
  - Sudden increase in DNS queries for uncommon or suspicious domains.
  - DNS records with shortened TTL (Time-to-Live) values indicating frequent or recent changes.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of DNS Server compromise is critical due to its potential severe impacts on organizations, including:

- **Data Loss and Credential Theft**:
  - Redirecting users to attacker-controlled servers can facilitate mass credential harvesting, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and financial loss.
- **Business and Operational Disruption**:
  - DNS attacks can disrupt normal operations by redirecting or denying access to legitimate services, causing downtime, reputational damage, and financial penalties.
- **Stealthy Persistence and Long-term Access**:
  - Attackers leveraging compromised DNS infrastructure can maintain persistent, stealthy access to victim networks, complicating detection, containment, and remediation efforts.
- **Supply Chain and Third-party Risk**:
  - Compromised DNS infrastructure of trusted third-party providers can indirectly expose multiple downstream organizations, amplifying the attack's impact and complexity.
- **Regulatory and Compliance Risks**:
  - Organizations may face severe regulatory penalties and compliance issues if sensitive data or customer information is compromised due to DNS manipulation.

## Examples

Real-world examples of DNS Server compromise include:

- **Sea Turtle Campaign (2017-2019)**:
  - Attack Scenario: Nation-state attackers compromised DNS registrars and DNS infrastructure providers to redirect DNS requests from government, military, and private organizations to attacker-controlled servers.
  - Tools and Methods: Credential theft, DNS hijacking, compromised registrar accounts.
  - Impact: Attackers gained access to sensitive emails, credentials, and confidential data, causing significant national security concerns.
- **DNSpionage Campaign (2018-2019)**:
  - Attack Scenario: Attackers compromised DNS infrastructure to redirect traffic from Middle Eastern government organizations and private companies to phishing and malware distribution pages.
  - Tools and Methods: Spear-phishing, DNS hijacking, malware deployment.
  - Impact: Credential theft, data exfiltration, and persistent espionage activities against targeted organizations.
- **Brazilian Bank DNS Hijacking (2016)**:
  - Attack Scenario: Attackers compromised DNS infrastructure of Brazilian banks, redirecting customers to phishing pages designed to steal banking credentials.
  - Tools and Methods: DNS record manipulation, phishing infrastructure setup.
  - Impact: Thousands of customers compromised, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage for the affected banks.

These examples illustrate the diverse scenarios, techniques, and significant impacts associated with DNS Server compromise, underscoring the importance of proactive detection and mitigation measures.

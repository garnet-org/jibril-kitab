# Malware [T1587.001]

## Information

- Name: Malware
- ID: T1587.001
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1587](./T1587.md)

## Introduction

Malware [T1587.001] is a sub-technique under the broader MITRE ATT&CK technique "Develop Capabilities (T1587)." It specifically addresses adversaries' development and deployment of malicious software—commonly known as malware—designed to gain unauthorized access, maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, or disrupt normal operations within targeted systems or networks. Adversaries employ malware to automate their attack processes, establish control over compromised endpoints, and facilitate further stages of their attack lifecycle.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Malware development typically involves several technical steps and methodologies:

- **Development and Compilation**:

  - Adversaries write custom code or modify existing malware samples to evade detection.
  - Common programming languages include C, C++, Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, and Go.
  - Malware is often compiled or obfuscated to bypass signature-based antivirus solutions.

- **Delivery Mechanisms**:

  - Malware is frequently delivered via phishing emails, malicious attachments, compromised websites, or software supply chain attacks.
  - Attackers may embed malware within legitimate software installers or updates to disguise malicious intent.

- **Persistence and Execution**:

  - Malware often leverages persistence mechanisms such as scheduled tasks, registry modifications, or service creation.
  - Common execution methods include DLL injection, reflective loading, or leveraging legitimate system utilities (e.g., PowerShell, MSHTA, rundll32).

- **Command-and-Control (C2)**:

  - Malware typically communicates with attacker-controlled servers to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional payloads.
  - Techniques used for C2 communication include HTTP/S, DNS tunneling, or custom protocols to evade detection.

- **Evasion Techniques**:
  - Malware authors implement techniques such as sandbox evasion, anti-debugging, anti-analysis, and obfuscation.
  - Polymorphic and metamorphic malware dynamically alter their code to evade signature-based detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Malware [T1587.001] is used across multiple phases of the cyberattack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access**:

  - Malware is often the initial payload delivered via phishing campaigns or watering-hole attacks to gain initial foothold in a target environment.

- **Execution and Persistence**:

  - Attackers leverage malware to execute commands, maintain persistent access, and establish backdoors for future exploitation.

- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:

  - Malware can be used to exploit vulnerabilities or escalate privileges on compromised hosts, facilitating lateral movement across networks.

- **Data Collection and Exfiltration**:

  - Malware can capture sensitive data, credentials, or intellectual property and transmit this data back to attacker-controlled infrastructure.

- **Impact and Disruption**:
  - Malware is also employed to disrupt normal operations, encrypt data (ransomware), or sabotage critical infrastructure and services.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malware typically involves multiple complementary methods and tools:

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:

  - EDR solutions detect suspicious processes, file activities, and behavioral anomalies indicative of malware execution.

- **Network Traffic Analysis**:

  - Monitoring network communications for anomalous traffic patterns, unusual domains/IP addresses, or encrypted communications to suspicious C2 servers.

- **Signature-Based Detection**:

  - Antivirus and anti-malware solutions identify known malware variants using static signatures and heuristic analysis.

- **Behavioral Analysis and Sandboxing**:

  - Sandboxes execute suspicious files in isolated environments, analyzing their behavior to detect malicious intent.

- **Threat Intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Leveraging threat intelligence feeds and IoCs (hashes, IP addresses, domains, file paths, registry keys) to proactively detect known malware.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) may include:

- Suspicious executable file hashes (MD5, SHA-256).
- Unusual registry entries for persistence (e.g., Run keys, scheduled tasks).
- Unexpected outbound network connections to unknown or malicious domains/IP addresses.
- Anomalous processes or injected DLLs running in memory.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of malware is critical to mitigating potential impacts and preventing widespread compromise. Possible impacts of undetected malware include:

- **Data Theft and Intellectual Property Loss**:

  - Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive corporate data, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII), leading to financial and reputational damage.

- **Operational Disruption**:

  - Malware such as ransomware can encrypt critical data and systems, causing significant downtime and disruption to business operations.

- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:

  - Malware often facilitates further compromise, enabling attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, and compromise additional systems.

- **Financial Loss and Regulatory Penalties**:

  - Organizations may incur financial losses due to ransom payments, recovery costs, or regulatory fines resulting from data breaches.

- **Reputational Damage**:
  - Public disclosure of data breaches or successful malware attacks can severely damage an organization's brand reputation and customer trust.

Early detection and response significantly reduce these risks by limiting the attacker’s ability to achieve their objectives, reducing dwell time, and facilitating rapid remediation.

## Examples

Real-world examples of malware usage in cyberattacks include:

- **NotPetya (2017)**:

  - Attack Scenario: Malware disguised as ransomware, delivered via compromised software updates (supply chain attack).
  - Tools and Techniques: EternalBlue exploit for lateral movement, Mimikatz for credential harvesting, SMB propagation.
  - Impact: Significant global disruption, billions of dollars in damages, affected multinational corporations and government agencies.

- **Emotet Malware**:

  - Attack Scenario: Delivered via malicious email attachments and URLs, used as a downloader and dropper for additional malware payloads.
  - Tools and Techniques: Macro-enabled documents, PowerShell scripts, network propagation.
  - Impact: Data theft, credential harvesting, widespread infections, and facilitating further attacks (e.g., TrickBot, Ryuk ransomware).

- **SolarWinds SUNBURST Backdoor (2020)**:

  - Attack Scenario: Supply-chain compromise through malicious software updates from trusted vendor (SolarWinds Orion).
  - Tools and Techniques: Custom malware implants, sophisticated command-and-control mechanisms, stealthy network communication.
  - Impact: Compromise of numerous high-profile organizations and government agencies, significant intelligence-gathering operations.

- **Ryuk Ransomware**:
  - Attack Scenario: Deployed after initial compromise via Emotet and TrickBot malware infections.
  - Tools and Techniques: Credential harvesting, lateral movement, encryption of critical files and systems.
  - Impact: Severe operational disruption, ransom demands, financial losses, and extended downtime for affected organizations.

These examples highlight the diverse scenarios, sophisticated techniques, and severe impacts associated with malware [T1587.001].

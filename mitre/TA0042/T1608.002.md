# Upload Tool

## Information

- Name: Upload Tool
- ID: T1608.002
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1608](T1608.md)

## Introduction

Upload Tool ([T1608.002](techniques/T1608.002.md)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader category of "Stage Capabilities" (T1608). This sub-technique involves adversaries uploading malicious tools, scripts, or payloads onto compromised systems to further their objectives. Uploading tools enables attackers to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, facilitate lateral movement, or exfiltrate sensitive data. Typically, adversaries leverage built-in operating system utilities, custom scripts, or third-party software to transfer these malicious payloads onto victim systems.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The Upload Tool technique involves adversaries placing malicious software or code onto compromised systems to facilitate further exploitation. This sub-technique can be executed through various technical methods:

- **Built-in Utilities and Protocols:**
  - Adversaries commonly use built-in protocols such as FTP, SMB, SCP, WinRM, or HTTP/HTTPS to upload tools to compromised hosts.
  - Native Windows utilities like `certutil.exe`, `bitsadmin.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `curl.exe` are frequently employed to download and upload malicious payloads.
- **Custom Scripts and Malware:**
  - Attackers may deploy custom scripts (e.g., PowerShell, Python, Bash) to automate uploading and deploying malware onto victim systems.
  - Malware may contain built-in upload capabilities to transfer additional payloads or tools after initial compromise.
- **Third-party Tools and Frameworks:**
  - Attackers commonly leverage penetration testing frameworks such as Metasploit, Empire, or Cobalt Strike, which include built-in capabilities for uploading and executing payloads.
  - Open-source tools such as `wget`, `curl`, or `scp` can also be utilized for uploading malicious binaries or scripts.
- **Obfuscation and Encoding:**
  - Attackers may obfuscate uploaded payloads using Base64 encoding, encryption, or compression to evade detection mechanisms.
  - Techniques like fileless execution, memory injection, or reflective DLL loading may accompany the upload of tools to complicate detection and analysis.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Upload Tool sub-technique can appear at multiple stages of an attack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
  - After gaining initial access, attackers upload reconnaissance tools or additional exploitation scripts to expand their foothold.
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Attackers upload privilege escalation scripts or binaries to elevate permissions and gain administrative access.
- **Persistence:**
  - Malicious tools or scripts are uploaded to maintain persistence, ensuring continued access to compromised systems.
- **Lateral Movement:**
  - Uploading credential dumping tools, remote administration utilities, or lateral movement scripts to propagate across the network.
- **Data Exfiltration:**
  - Attackers upload specialized exfiltration tools or utilities to facilitate data extraction from compromised hosts.
- **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
  - Uploading tools that establish persistent communication channels or enable remote command execution.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Upload Tool sub-technique involves multiple layers and approaches:

- **Endpoint Monitoring:**
  - Monitor process execution logs for suspicious utilities (`certutil`, `curl`, `wget`, `bitsadmin`, `scp`, `powershell`) downloading or uploading files.
  - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect unusual file creation, script execution, or binary deployment.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  - Identify unusual network connections or protocols (FTP, SMB, SCP, HTTP/HTTPS) used for file transfers.
  - Monitor network traffic for anomalous data transfer patterns, unusual file sizes, or irregular upload/download activity.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
  - Implement FIM solutions to detect unauthorized changes or additions of files, scripts, or binaries on critical systems.
- **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection:**
  - Utilize behavioral analytics tools to detect abnormal user activity, unusual file uploads, or unexpected scripts running on endpoints.
  - Deploy Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to correlate logs and identify anomalous file transfers.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Suspicious file hashes, filenames, file paths, or script contents.
  - Unusual file extensions or hidden files appearing on systems.
  - Abnormal timestamps or metadata indicating suspicious file uploads.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of the Upload Tool sub-technique is crucial due to its potential impact on security posture and business continuity:

- **Privilege Escalation and System Compromise:**
  - Uploaded tools often facilitate privilege escalation, enabling attackers to gain administrative access and control over critical systems.
- **Persistence and Long-term Compromise:**
  - Uploaded malicious scripts or binaries can establish persistent footholds, allowing attackers prolonged access to victim environments.
- **Data Theft and Exfiltration:**
  - Uploading specialized tools can enable attackers to extract sensitive data, intellectual property, or confidential information, leading to financial losses and compliance violations.
- **Lateral Movement and Network-wide Impact:**
  - Uploaded tools can facilitate lateral movement, enabling attackers to propagate rapidly across the network and compromise multiple systems.
- **Reputation and Compliance Risks:**
  - Failure to detect malicious uploads can result in data breaches, regulatory penalties, loss of customer trust, and significant reputational damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples of adversaries using the Upload Tool sub-technique include:

- **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**
  - Used PowerShell scripts and custom malware uploaded via legitimate protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) to compromised hosts to establish persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
- **FIN7 (Carbanak):**
  - Uploaded custom tools and scripts such as Cobalt Strike payloads, PowerShell scripts, and credential harvesting utilities to compromised systems for lateral movement and data theft from financial institutions.
- **Lazarus Group:**
  - Uploaded malicious binaries and scripts via SMB and FTP protocols, leveraging native Windows utilities (`certutil.exe`, `bitsadmin.exe`) to facilitate payload delivery and lateral movement within targeted networks.
- **TrickBot Malware:**
  - Uploaded additional modules and tools after initial infection, including credential stealing modules, reconnaissance scripts, and lateral movement utilities.
- **Red Team and Penetration Testing Examples:**
  - Penetration testers regularly upload tools such as Mimikatz, PsExec, Metasploit payloads, or PowerShell scripts to simulate real-world adversary behavior and test organizational detection capabilities.

In each of these examples, attackers successfully leveraged the Upload Tool sub-technique to achieve objectives such as persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, highlighting the critical importance of effective detection and mitigation strategies.

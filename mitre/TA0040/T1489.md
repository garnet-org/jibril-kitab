# Service Stop

## Information

- Name: Service Stop
- ID: T1489
- Tactics: [TA0040](../TA0040/TA0040.md)

## Introduction

The "Service Stop" technique (MITRE ATT\&CK ID: T1489) refers to adversaries stopping or disabling legitimate services on target systems to disrupt operations, evade detection, or facilitate further malicious actions. Attackers may halt critical security services, monitoring tools, or essential business applications to impair defenses, degrade system availability, or create conditions favorable for their objectives. This tactic is part of the "Impact" category within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework and is commonly used to impede organizational response capabilities or cause disruption.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers use various methods and tools to stop or disable services on compromised systems:

- **Native Operating System Commands and Utilities:**
  - **Windows:**
    - `net stop <service_name>`
    - `sc stop <service_name>`
    - `taskkill /F /IM <process_name>`
    - PowerShell commands (`Stop-Service`, `Set-Service -StartupType Disabled`)
  - **Linux/Unix:**
    - `systemctl stop <service>`
    - `service <service> stop`
    - `kill`, `killall` commands targeting service processes
    - Modifying init scripts or systemd configurations to prevent services from restarting
- **Scripting and Automation:**
  - Attackers frequently use scripts (PowerShell, Bash, Python) to automate the stopping or disabling of multiple services simultaneously.
  - Custom malware scripts may systematically terminate security-related services to evade detection and response.
- **Malicious Tools and Frameworks:**
  - Tools such as Metasploit, Empire, Cobalt Strike, and custom malware frameworks can automate service termination.
  - Ransomware variants often include routines to disable antivirus and backup-related services before encryption.
- **Abuse of Administrative Privileges:**
  - Attackers who gain administrative-level privileges can manipulate service configurations directly from the registry (Windows) or configuration files (Linux) to disable or permanently stop services.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ the Service Stop technique across multiple stages and scenarios during an intrusion:

- **Initial Access and Execution:**
  - To disable antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions immediately upon initial compromise, allowing malware deployment.
- **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**
  - To terminate monitoring, logging, or security services, reducing the likelihood of detection and increasing persistence.
- **Impact Phase (Disruption or Destruction):**
  - During ransomware attacks to disable backups, database services, or security tools before encryption.
  - In destructive attacks to cause denial-of-service or operational disruption by stopping critical business services.
- **Persistence and Lateral Movement:**
  - To prevent security services from restarting automatically, attackers may modify service startup configurations, ensuring continued access and lateral movement without detection.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Organizations can detect the Service Stop technique through multiple methods, tools, and indicators:

- **Monitoring and Alerting on Specific Events:**
  - Windows Event Logs:
    - Event ID 7036 (Service Control Manager) - indicates service state changes.
    - Event ID 7040 (Service Control Manager) - indicates changes to service startup type.
    - Event ID 7031/7034 (Unexpected service termination).
  - Linux Syslog or systemd journal logs:
    - Logs indicating stopped services (`systemctl status`, `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`).
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**
  - Detect unusual or unauthorized stopping of security-related services.
  - Alert on scripting or command-line activity indicative of service manipulation.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
  - Correlation rules and alerts configured to detect rapid or unauthorized service terminations.
  - Baseline monitoring to detect deviations from standard service behavior.
- **File Integrity Monitoring and Configuration Management Tools:**
  - Detect unauthorized modifications to service-related configuration files or registry keys.
  - Tools such as OSSEC, Tripwire, or auditd can help detect changes in service status or configurations.
- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Unusual or unexpected service stops or disabled startup types.
  - Command-line indicators:
    - Windows: `net stop`, `sc stop`, `taskkill`, PowerShell service manipulation commands.
    - Unix/Linux: `systemctl stop`, `service stop`, `kill`, `killall`.
  - Suspicious scripts or binaries found on endpoints designed explicitly to terminate security or backup services.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of the Service Stop technique is critical due to its significant potential impact on systems and networks:

- **Disruption of Critical Services:**
  - Stopping essential business or infrastructure services can cause operational downtime, productivity losses, and financial impacts.
- **Security Posture Weakening:**
  - Disabling security services (antivirus, EDR, logging) directly reduces visibility, allowing attackers to persist undetected.
- **Facilitation of Further Malicious Activities:**
  - Attackers may leverage service stoppage to deploy ransomware, malware, data exfiltration tools, or carry out lateral movement without interference.
- **Data Loss and Recovery Challenges:**
  - Disabling backup and recovery services increases the difficulty of restoring data and recovering from attacks, particularly ransomware incidents.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Risks:**
  - Loss of logging or monitoring services can lead to compliance violations, audit failures, and regulatory penalties.

Detecting and responding promptly to this technique can significantly limit attacker impact, reduce downtime, and mitigate the potential damage to organizational assets and reputation.

## Examples

Real-world examples of adversaries utilizing the Service Stop technique include:

- **Ryuk Ransomware:**
  - Attack Scenario: Before encrypting files, Ryuk stops backup and antivirus services to prevent recovery and detection.
  - Tools/Methods Used: Windows native commands (`net stop`, `sc stop`), scripting (batch scripts).
  - Impact: Significant data loss, operational disruption, and costly recovery efforts across numerous organizations.
- **MegaCortex Ransomware:**
  - Attack Scenario: MegaCortex systematically disables endpoint protection, backup solutions, and database services to ensure successful encryption.
  - Tools/Methods Used: Batch and PowerShell scripts, command-line utilities (`taskkill`, `net stop`, `sc stop`).
  - Impact: Extensive business disruption, high ransom demands, and substantial remediation costs.
- **NotPetya Malware Attack (2017):**
  - Attack Scenario: NotPetya disabled antivirus and security services on infected machines before destructive encryption.
  - Tools/Methods Used: Custom malware routines, native Windows commands.
  - Impact: Global disruption, massive financial damages estimated in billions of dollars, severe operational downtime.
- **APT Groups and Targeted Intrusions:**
  - Attack Scenario: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors often disable logging and monitoring services to evade detection during espionage campaigns.
  - Tools/Methods Used: Custom scripts, command-line utilities, malware implants.
  - Impact: Long-term espionage, data exfiltration, intellectual property theft, and compromised security posture.

These examples highlight the critical need for robust monitoring, detection, and response capabilities to mitigate the severe impacts associated with the Service Stop technique.

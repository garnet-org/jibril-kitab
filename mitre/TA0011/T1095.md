# Non-Application Layer Protocol

## Information

- Name: Non-Application Layer Protocol
- ID: T1095
- Tactics: [TA0011](../TA0011/TA0011.md)

## Introduction

Non-Application Layer Protocol is a technique categorized under MITRE ATT\&CK framework (Technique ID: T1095). Adversaries leverage network protocols that operate below the application layer (OSI layers 3 and 4, such as ICMP, TCP, UDP) to communicate, control compromised systems, exfiltrate data, and evade detection. By utilizing these lower-level protocols, attackers can bypass traditional security defenses that primarily monitor application-layer traffic (e.g., HTTP, DNS).

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers utilize Non-Application Layer Protocols to establish covert communication channels, evade network monitoring, and maintain persistent access. Technical execution methods typically involve:

- **ICMP Tunneling:**
  - Embedding payloads within ICMP echo request/reply packets.
  - Tools such as ICMP Shell, PingTunnel, or Loki can facilitate command and control (C2) communication or data exfiltration.
- **UDP and TCP Covert Channels:**
  - Manipulating packet headers and payloads to hide data within legitimate protocol traffic.
  - Techniques include embedding data in TCP sequence numbers, acknowledgment fields, or UDP payloads.
  - Tools like DNScat2 (over UDP), ptunnel, or iodine are commonly employed.
- **Protocol Misuse and Fragmentation:**
  - Fragmenting packets to evade IDS/IPS detection.
  - Abnormal use of flags, packet sizes, or header fields to embed malicious payloads or instructions.
- **Custom Protocols and Raw Sockets:**
  - Crafting custom protocols or utilizing raw sockets to directly manipulate packet headers.
  - This approach allows attackers to evade signature-based detections and standard protocol inspection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers may employ Non-Application Layer Protocol techniques across various stages of the attack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
  - Using ICMP or UDP packets to probe network boundaries, firewall rules, and system responsiveness.
- **Command and Control (C2):**
  - Establishing covert communication channels to remotely control compromised hosts without detection by standard application-layer monitoring.
- **Data Exfiltration:**
  - Transferring sensitive data out of the victim network through covert channels embedded in lower-level protocols, bypassing traditional data loss prevention (DLP) systems.
- **Persistence and Evasion:**
  - Maintaining long-term covert communication channels to evade detection by security monitoring solutions focused primarily on application-layer traffic.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Non-Application Layer Protocol exploitation can be challenging, but several methods and tools can assist:

- **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  - Monitoring for unusual patterns or anomalies in ICMP, TCP, or UDP traffic.
  - Tools such as Wireshark, Zeek (formerly Bro), Suricata, and Snort can detect abnormal protocol usage or unusual packet structures.
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:**
  - Implementing machine learning-based or heuristic analysis systems (e.g., Darktrace, Cisco Stealthwatch) to identify deviations from typical network behaviors.
  - Detecting unusual ICMP payload sizes, high volumes of ICMP traffic, or irregular TCP/UDP packet fragmentation.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  - Monitoring system-level socket operations, raw socket usage, and unusual network connections.
  - Tools such as CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can detect suspicious process behavior or network activity.
- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - High frequency of ICMP echo requests/replies from a single host.
  - Unusual fragmentation patterns or abnormal TCP/UDP packet sizes.
  - Connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains associated with covert channel tools.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Non-Application Layer Protocol misuse is critical due to several high-impact risks:

- **Stealthy Data Exfiltration:**
  - Attackers can silently remove large volumes of sensitive data, intellectual property, or confidential information without triggering traditional alerts.
- **Persistent Command and Control:**
  - Covert communication channels can remain active for extended periods, allowing attackers continuous control and access to compromised systems.
- **Security Monitoring Evasion:**
  - Traditional security solutions concentrating on application-layer traffic may fail to detect lower-layer protocol misuse, leaving organizations blind to ongoing malicious activities.
- **Operational Disruption and Damage:**
  - Undetected covert channels can facilitate lateral movement, privilege escalation, and deployment of additional malicious payloads, significantly increasing the potential impact of an attack.

Early detection and mitigation of Non-Application Layer Protocol abuse help prevent attackers from achieving their objectives, limiting potential damage and maintaining organizational security posture.

## Examples

Real-world examples highlighting the usage and impact of Non-Application Layer Protocol attacks include:

- **Operation TunnelSnake (ICMP Tunneling):**
  - Attackers used ICMP tunneling to establish persistent covert channels, evade detection, and exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised networks.
  - Tools involved included PingTunnel and ICMP Shell, allowing attackers to bypass firewall rules blocking traditional application-layer protocols.
- **Loki ICMP Tunneling:**
  - Loki is a publicly available tool that embeds payloads within ICMP packets to establish covert C2 channels.
  - Attackers leveraged Loki in targeted attacks to maintain persistent and stealthy communication with compromised hosts, bypassing standard IDS/IPS systems.
- **DNScat2 (UDP Protocol Abuse):**
  - DNScat2 utilizes DNS queries (UDP protocol) to establish covert communication channels and exfiltrate data.
  - Attackers employed DNScat2 in multiple documented breaches, successfully evading monitoring solutions focused on HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups:**
  - APT29 (Cozy Bear) and APT28 (Fancy Bear) have historically leveraged lower-layer protocol tunneling and covert channels to evade detection, perform reconnaissance, and exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted networks.
  - These sophisticated adversaries frequently employ customized implementations of ICMP and UDP tunneling to remain undetected and maintain long-term access.

These examples underscore the critical importance of monitoring and detecting Non-Application Layer Protocol abuse to prevent severe security implications and mitigate potential damage from sophisticated cyber-attacks.

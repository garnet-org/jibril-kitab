# Communication Through Removable Media [T1092]

## Information

- Name: Communication Through Removable Media
- ID: T1092
- Tactics: [TA0011](../TA0011/TA0011.md)

## Introduction

Communication Through Removable Media is a documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1092), categorized under Command and Control (C2). This technique involves adversaries using removable media, such as USB drives, external hard drives, CDs/DVDs, or memory cards, to transfer commands, data, or malware between compromised systems and attacker-controlled infrastructure. It is particularly useful for attackers operating in air-gapped or otherwise isolated environments, where traditional network-based command and control channels are unavailable or monitored closely. By leveraging removable media, attackers can bypass network-based defenses, evade detection, and maintain persistence within targeted environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers leveraging Communication Through Removable Media typically follow a structured methodology:

- **Preparation and Infection:**

  - Adversaries initially infect removable media with malicious payloads or hidden files.
  - Malware on removable media may be disguised as legitimate files or hidden using file attributes, encryption, or steganography.

- **Propagation and Execution Methods:**

  - Auto-execution via Autorun.inf files (historically common, though mitigated in modern systems).
  - Social engineering techniques prompting users to open malicious files.
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in software that automatically processes files from removable media.

- **Data Exfiltration and Command & Control:**

  - Attackers store commands or instructions on removable media, which compromised systems read and execute upon insertion.
  - Compromised systems may write collected sensitive data back onto removable media for later retrieval by attackers.
  - The removable media thus becomes a covert communication channel, bridging air-gapped or isolated environments.

- **Mechanisms and Tools Used:**
  - Custom malware designed for removable media propagation (e.g., Stuxnet).
  - Tools for data encryption or steganography to hide malicious payloads.
  - Scripts or batch files that automate data collection, command execution, and data exfiltration.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This technique is commonly employed in the following attack scenarios and stages:

- **Initial Access and Delivery:**

  - Introducing malware into highly secured, air-gapped networks or isolated environments.
  - Targeting organizations or facilities with strict network perimeter controls.

- **Command and Control (C2) Stage:**

  - Establishing covert communication channels when traditional network-based C2 channels are blocked, monitored, or unavailable.
  - Maintaining long-term persistence in isolated environments without alerting network monitoring systems.

- **Data Exfiltration:**

  - Extracting sensitive or classified information from secure environments without network connectivity.
  - Transferring collected data to attacker-controlled systems through physical media.

- **Lateral Movement:**
  - Spreading malware internally within an organization by infecting removable media used by multiple employees or departments.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods and indicators commonly utilized include:

- **Endpoint Monitoring and Logging:**

  - Monitoring and logging USB device insertions and removals.
  - Tracking file creation, modification, and deletion events associated with removable media.

- **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**

  - Identifying unusual or unexpected file transfers to and from removable media.
  - Detecting hidden or encrypted files on removable storage devices.

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**

  - Monitoring critical systems for unauthorized file changes associated with removable media interactions.

- **Antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**

  - Scanning removable media upon insertion for known malware signatures or suspicious files.
  - Using heuristic detection methods to identify suspicious behaviors or file structures.

- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Presence of Autorun.inf files or scripts designed for automatic execution upon media insertion.
  - Suspicious encrypted containers or steganographically hidden files.
  - Unusual timestamps or metadata anomalies on removable media files.
  - Registry entries indicating USB device insertions, particularly those from unknown or unauthorized devices.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early and accurate detection of Communication Through Removable Media is critical for several reasons:

- **Preventing Data Loss and Espionage:**

  - Sensitive or classified information can be exfiltrated covertly via removable media, leading to severe data breaches and espionage incidents.

- **Protecting Air-Gapped and Critical Infrastructure Systems:**

  - Many critical infrastructures, industrial control systems (ICS), and sensitive government networks rely on air-gapping for security. Removable media attacks bypass these security measures, potentially causing catastrophic impacts.

- **Stopping Malware Spread and Persistence:**

  - Malware introduced through removable media can spread rapidly and silently, maintaining persistence even when network-based controls are robust.

- **Reducing Operational and Financial Impacts:**

  - Early detection and response minimize downtime, remediation costs, and reputational damage associated with successful attacks.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:**
  - Many industries require stringent controls around removable media usage. Detecting unauthorized removable media interactions helps organizations remain compliant with regulatory standards.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating Communication Through Removable Media include:

- **Stuxnet (2010):**

  - **Scenario:** Targeted Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, specifically air-gapped industrial control systems.
  - **Tools and Techniques:** Exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, utilized USB drives to propagate malware and transfer commands.
  - **Impact:** Successfully disrupted uranium enrichment processes, causing physical damage to centrifuges and delaying nuclear program.

- **Agent.btz (2008):**

  - **Scenario:** Malware infection within the U.S. military classified networks, introduced via infected removable media.
  - **Tools and Techniques:** Leveraged Autorun features and removable media to propagate within isolated networks.
  - **Impact:** Led to significant operational disruptions, extensive remediation efforts, and policy changes regarding removable media usage.

- **Flame Malware (2012):**

  - **Scenario:** Cyber espionage operation targeting Middle Eastern countries, particularly Iran.
  - **Tools and Techniques:** Used removable media to spread malware between isolated systems and to exfiltrate sensitive information covertly.
  - **Impact:** Extensive espionage operation, compromising confidential information and communications.

- **Raspberry Robin Worm (2022):**
  - **Scenario:** Malware spread via infected USB devices to establish persistence and download additional payloads.
  - **Tools and Techniques:** Used Windows shortcut (.lnk) files on removable media to trigger malicious payload downloads.
  - **Impact:** Enabled attackers to deploy additional malware, including ransomware, within enterprise environments.

These examples illustrate the versatility, effectiveness, and severe impacts associated with Communication Through Removable Media, underscoring the importance of robust detection and prevention strategies.

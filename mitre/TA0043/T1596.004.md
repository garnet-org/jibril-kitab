# CDNs [T1596.004]

## Information

- Name: CDNs
- ID: T1596.004
- Tactics: [TA0043](../TA0043/TA0043.md)
- Technique: [T1596](./T1596.md)

## Introduction

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) (MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique ID: T1596.004) represent a sub-technique within the broader category of Supply Chain Compromise (T1596). Attackers exploit trusted CDNs to deliver malware, stage command-and-control (C2) channels, or distribute malicious content. CDNs are widely used to improve web content delivery performance, reliability, and availability, making them appealing targets for adversaries. By compromising or abusing CDNs, attackers leverage trusted infrastructure to evade detection, circumvent security controls, and deliver malicious payloads to targeted victims.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers utilize CDNs in several distinct ways to facilitate their malicious objectives:

- **Malicious Content Hosting:** Adversaries may compromise legitimate CDN accounts or infrastructure to host malware payloads, scripts, or phishing pages. Victims accessing the compromised CDN receive malicious content from a seemingly trusted and reputable source, bypassing traditional security checks.

- **Domain Fronting:** Attackers may leverage CDN infrastructure to obfuscate C2 communications through domain fronting techniques. Domain fronting involves routing traffic through legitimate CDN domains to disguise the actual destination of network traffic, making detection and attribution difficult.

- **Cache Poisoning and Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate CDN caching mechanisms by injecting malicious content into cached files or responses. When legitimate users request these cached resources, they unknowingly download malicious scripts or payloads.

- **Credential Theft and Hijacking:** Attackers may target CDN account credentials through phishing or credential stuffing attacks. Once compromised, attackers can inject malicious code into legitimate CDN-hosted resources, affecting potentially thousands of users simultaneously.

Technical execution methods include:

1. **Compromise of CDN Account Credentials:** Phishing, brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of weak or reused passwords.

2. **Exploitation of CDN Vulnerabilities:** Targeting vulnerabilities in CDN infrastructure or APIs to gain unauthorized access or modify content.

3. **Injection of Malicious Scripts:** Embedding malicious JavaScript or other payloads into legitimate CDN-hosted scripts, images, or other resources.

4. **Domain Fronting Techniques:** Configuring CDN services to route C2 traffic through trusted CDN domains, obfuscating true network destinations.

Real-world procedures involve attackers performing reconnaissance on CDN providers, identifying vulnerable accounts or infrastructure, obtaining access credentials, and injecting malicious payloads into legitimate content. Attackers typically use automation tools, scripts, and custom malware to streamline these operations.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique appears across various attack scenarios and stages, including:

- **Initial Access:** Attackers leverage compromised CDNs to deliver initial malware payloads, phishing pages, or malicious scripts to victims.

- **Execution and Persistence:** Embedding malicious scripts or payloads in CDN-hosted resources ensures persistent delivery and execution on victim systems.

- **Command-and-Control (C2):** Attackers utilize CDNs to obfuscate or disguise C2 communications, making detection and attribution challenging.

- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers may abuse CDN infrastructure to exfiltrate sensitive data, leveraging trusted channels to evade network monitoring and detection.

Typical attack scenarios include:

- Large-scale watering hole attacks, where attackers compromise CDN-hosted scripts or resources accessed by multiple organizations.

- Targeted phishing attacks leveraging CDN-hosted malicious pages or payloads to evade email security gateways.

- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns utilizing CDN infrastructure for stealthy and persistent C2 communications and payload delivery.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods and indicators of compromise (IoCs) for CDN-based attacks include:

- **Network Traffic Analysis:**

  - Monitoring for anomalous or suspicious traffic patterns related to CDN domains, especially unusual request frequencies, payload sizes, or unusual subdomains.
  - Identifying domain fronting by detecting discrepancies between SNI (Server Name Indication) and HTTP Host headers.

- **Endpoint Monitoring:**

  - Detecting unexpected scripts, executables, or payloads downloaded from CDN domains.
  - Monitoring browser behavior for unexpected CDN-hosted JavaScript executions or unusual content loading patterns.

- **Log Analysis and SIEM Correlation:**

  - Analyzing CDN access logs for unusual activity, IP addresses, or credential access events.
  - Correlating CDN access patterns with known malicious indicators, threat intelligence feeds, and behavioral analytics.

- **Threat Intelligence Integration:**

  - Leveraging threat intelligence feeds to identify compromised CDN domains, malicious CDN-hosted content, or known attacker infrastructure.

- **Content Integrity Monitoring:**
  - Regularly scanning CDN-hosted resources for unauthorized changes, malicious code injections, or unexpected content modifications.

Specific IoCs include:

- Known malicious CDN URLs or subdomains.
- Suspicious JavaScript, PowerShell, or executable payloads hosted on CDN domains.
- Unusual DNS queries or HTTP requests directed to CDN infrastructure.
- Inconsistencies between TLS SNI headers and HTTP Host headers indicative of domain fronting.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting CDN abuse is critical due to the significant potential impacts and challenges associated with this technique:

- **Widespread Impact:** Compromised CDN resources can affect numerous organizations simultaneously, leading to large-scale malware infections, credential theft, or data breaches.

- **Detection Evasion:** Attackers leverage trusted CDN infrastructure to bypass traditional security measures, evade detection, and obfuscate malicious activities.

- **Reputational Damage:** Organizations unknowingly serving malicious content via compromised CDNs face severe reputational harm, loss of user trust, and potential legal liability.

- **Operational Disruption:** CDN compromise can disrupt legitimate business operations, degrade website performance, and negatively impact user experience and productivity.

- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** APT groups frequently utilize CDN abuses for stealthy, persistent, and targeted attacks, making detection essential for defense against sophisticated adversaries.

Early detection enables organizations to:

- Quickly remediate compromised CDN resources to minimize damage.
- Prevent widespread malware infections and data breaches.
- Maintain user trust, operational stability, and regulatory compliance.
- Enhance threat intelligence capabilities and defensive posture against advanced threats.

## Examples

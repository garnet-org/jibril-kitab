- Technique: [T1598](T1598.md)

## Introduction

Spearphishing Voice (T1598.004) is a targeted social engineering attack sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. It involves threat actors using voice communication—typically via phone calls or voice messaging—to deceive specific individuals within an organization. Attackers impersonate trusted entities or known contacts to manipulate victims into revealing sensitive information, credentials, or performing actions beneficial to the attacker. This method leverages psychological manipulation, urgency, and personal trust to enhance the likelihood of successful exploitation.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Spearphishing Voice, commonly referred to as "vishing," involves the targeted use of voice communications to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing unauthorized actions. Attackers typically follow a structured process:

- **Reconnaissance and Targeting**:
  - Attackers first gather detailed information about the target individual or organization, often using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques, social media platforms, company websites, or leaked data.
  - Information collected may include job roles, responsibilities, contact details, management hierarchy, and personal connections.
- **Preparation and Impersonation**:
  - Attackers carefully craft a credible persona, often impersonating colleagues, executives, IT support, vendors, or trusted third-party representatives.
  - Voice alteration software or spoofed caller ID numbers may be used to enhance credibility and mask true identities.
  - Scripts or scenarios are developed to create a believable narrative tailored specifically to the target's context and role.
- **Execution and Manipulation**:
  - Attackers initiate direct phone calls or leave voice messages with urgency-driven narratives, such as security issues, account problems, urgent financial transactions, or critical business requests.
  - Psychological manipulation techniques—authority, urgency, reciprocity, or familiarity—are employed to pressure victims into immediate action without proper verification.
- **Exploitation and Follow-up**:
  - Victims may be persuaded to disclose sensitive data (passwords, account details, personal information), perform unauthorized financial transfers, or install malicious software.
  - Follow-up communications may be used to maintain credibility, gather additional details, or escalate privileges within the targeted environment.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ Spearphishing Voice techniques in various stages and scenarios, including:

- **Initial Access**:
  - To gain credentials or sensitive information that provides initial entry into a secure network or system.
- **Credential Access and Privilege Escalation**:
  - To deceive employees into revealing login credentials or sensitive authentication details, enabling lateral movement or escalated privileges within the compromised environment.
- **Social Engineering Campaigns**:
  - Combined with email-based spearphishing (phishing) campaigns to enhance credibility and increase the likelihood of successful compromise.
- **Financial Fraud and Business Email Compromise (BEC)**:
  - To impersonate executives or financial officers, convincing employees to authorize fraudulent financial transactions or disclose sensitive financial information.
- **Information Gathering and Espionage**:
  - To extract confidential corporate or proprietary information from targeted individuals, facilitating industrial espionage or competitive advantage.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Effective detection of Spearphishing Voice attacks typically involves a combination of technical, procedural, and behavioral measures:

- **User Awareness and Training**:
  - Educating employees to recognize suspicious voice communications, unusual requests, or urgency-driven pressure tactics.
  - Training personnel to verify caller identity through independent channels or known contacts before disclosing sensitive information.
- **Technical Controls and Monitoring**:
  - Implementing voice call logging and monitoring solutions to detect unusual or suspicious call patterns.
  - Utilizing caller ID verification and anti-spoofing technologies to identify and flag spoofed or suspicious phone numbers.
- **Behavioral Analysis and Policy Enforcement**:
  - Establishing strict policies and procedures for sensitive information disclosure and financial transactions, requiring multi-factor verification and approval.
  - Monitoring for deviations from established communication patterns, unusual call timing, or unexpected requests from known contacts.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Repeated calls from unknown or unexpected numbers, especially those attempting to impersonate internal personnel or trusted third parties.
  - Voice calls requesting sensitive information, credentials, or urgent financial transactions without standard verification procedures.
  - Reports from employees regarding suspicious voice interactions or follow-up communications.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early and effective detection of Spearphishing Voice attacks is critical due to significant potential impacts, including:

- **Financial Losses**:
  - Unauthorized financial transactions, fraudulent wire transfers, or financial fraud resulting from successful impersonation and deception.
- **Credential Compromise and Unauthorized Access**:
  - Disclosure of sensitive credentials enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within corporate networks.
- **Data Breaches and Information Leakage**:
  - Exposure or theft of sensitive corporate, personal, or proprietary information, potentially resulting in regulatory penalties, reputational damage, or competitive disadvantage.
- **Operational Disruption**:
  - Incidents causing operational downtime, resource diversion, and disruption of normal business activities.
- **Reputation and Trust Damage**:
  - Successful attacks damaging customer trust, public reputation, and stakeholder confidence, potentially leading to long-term business impacts.

Proactive detection and response measures, combined with robust user awareness training, significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation and mitigate potential damages.

## Examples

Real-world instances and notable examples of Spearphishing Voice attacks include:

- **Twitter Account Compromise (2020)**:
  - Attackers utilized vishing techniques to deceive Twitter employees into providing internal system credentials, allowing attackers to hijack high-profile Twitter accounts and conduct cryptocurrency scams.
  - Attackers impersonated internal IT support personnel, creating urgency around a fabricated security issue, leading employees to disclose sensitive credentials.
- **GoDaddy Employee Vishing Attack (2020)**:
  - Attackers successfully deceived GoDaddy employees via targeted voice calls, resulting in unauthorized access to customer accounts and sensitive data.
  - The attackers posed as trusted internal support representatives, leveraging personal trust and urgency to extract credentials.
- **Financial Services Industry Attacks**:
  - Numerous documented cases involving attackers impersonating executives or financial officers through targeted voice calls, convincing employees to authorize fraudulent wire transfers or disclose sensitive financial details.
  - Attackers leveraged detailed organizational knowledge and social engineering tactics to increase the credibility of their impersonation.
- **Vishing Campaign Targeting Remote Workers (2021-2022)**:
  - Attackers targeted remote employees across various industries, impersonating internal IT departments or trusted helpdesk representatives, persuading victims to reveal VPN credentials or install malicious remote access software.
  - This resulted in unauthorized network access, data breaches, and operational disruptions.

These examples illustrate the diverse scenarios, attacker tactics, and significant impacts associated with Spearphishing Voice attacks, emphasizing the importance of awareness, detection, and preventive measures.

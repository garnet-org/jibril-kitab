## Information

- Name: Hardware
- ID: T1592.001
- Tactics: [TA0043](../TA0043/TA0043.md)
- Technique: [T1592](T1592.md)

## Introduction

Hardware (T1592.001) is a sub-technique of the Supply Chain Compromise (T1592) technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. It involves adversaries manipulating hardware components or devices during their manufacturing, distribution, or installation phases to compromise targeted systems or networks. The goal is to establish persistent and stealthy access, enabling attackers to execute malicious activities undetected for prolonged periods.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Hardware supply chain compromise occurs when adversaries alter or implant malicious components within hardware devices or systems during their production, transportation, or installation processes. Technical details and execution methods include:

- **Hardware Implantation**:
  - Attackers embed malicious chips, firmware, or physical modifications into legitimate hardware components.
  - Implants can be designed to intercept data, provide remote access, or disrupt normal device functionality.
- **Firmware Manipulation**:
  - Adversaries may modify firmware images within hardware devices to introduce backdoors or malicious code.
  - Firmware-level compromise allows attackers to evade traditional software-based detection mechanisms.
- **Supply Chain Interception**:
  - Attackers intercept shipments or manipulate logistics channels to insert compromised hardware into legitimate distribution channels.
  - This method leverages trusted supply chain processes to bypass security scrutiny.
- **Hardware Trojans**:
  - Malicious circuits or logic embedded within integrated circuits (ICs) or printed circuit boards (PCBs).
  - Designed to remain dormant until triggered by specific conditions, signals, or commands.
- **Peripheral Device Compromise**:
  - Malicious USB devices, keyboards, mice, or other peripherals that contain hidden implants or malicious firmware.
  - These compromised peripherals can facilitate initial access, lateral movement, or persistent backdoors.

Adversaries leveraging hardware compromise typically possess advanced resources, skills, and knowledge of hardware engineering, manufacturing processes, and supply chain logistics.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique commonly appears in scenarios involving:

- **Nation-State Espionage**:
  - Targeting critical infrastructure, military, government, or corporate entities to conduct long-term espionage operations.
  - Establishing stealthy, persistent footholds within high-value targets.
- **Sabotage and Disruption Operations**:
  - Manipulating hardware in critical systems (e.g., industrial control systems, telecommunications equipment) to disrupt operations or cause physical damage.
- **Intellectual Property Theft**:
  - Compromising hardware devices in targeted organizations to exfiltrate sensitive data, proprietary designs, or trade secrets.
- **Supply Chain Attacks Against Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**:
  - Introducing compromised hardware into MSP supply chains to gain broad access to multiple downstream customer networks.
- **High-Value Target Compromise**:
  - Attacking hardware intended for high-profile individuals, executives, or sensitive governmental/military applications to facilitate targeted surveillance.

Attackers typically employ this technique during early stages of the cyber kill chain (initial access and persistence stages), ensuring long-term, stealthy, and reliable access to victim environments.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of hardware supply chain compromise is challenging due to its stealthy nature. However, several methods, tools, and indicators can help identify compromised hardware:

- **Physical Inspection**:
  - Conduct visual inspections for evidence of tampering, unauthorized modifications, or suspicious components on hardware devices.
  - Utilize X-ray imaging or electron microscopy to detect hidden implants or alterations.
- **Firmware Integrity Verification**:
  - Regularly verify firmware integrity using cryptographic hashes, digital signatures, and trusted firmware images.
  - Employ secure boot processes to detect unauthorized firmware modifications.
- **Network Monitoring and Analysis**:
  - Monitor network traffic for anomalous communications originating from hardware devices, including unexpected outbound connections, unusual ports, or encrypted channels.
  - Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify suspicious behaviors.
- **Hardware Behavior Analysis**:
  - Analyze hardware performance metrics, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions for anomalies indicating malicious implants.
  - Conduct side-channel analysis or hardware profiling to detect deviations from expected behavior.
- **Supply Chain Risk Management**:
  - Perform thorough background checks and vetting of hardware manufacturers and suppliers.
  - Establish secure procurement and delivery processes, including tamper-evident packaging and secure transport protocols.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

- Unexpected hardware components or chips not matching original design specifications.
- Modified firmware images or unexplained firmware updates.
- Suspicious network connections or command-and-control (C2) communications originating from hardware devices.
- Unusual hardware performance characteristics or anomalies detected during hardware profiling tests.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of hardware supply chain compromise is critical due to the following potential impacts:

- **Long-term Persistent Access**:
  - Compromised hardware provides attackers with persistent, stealthy access that is difficult to detect or remediate through standard software-based security solutions.
- **Significant Operational Disruption**:
  - Malicious hardware implants can disrupt critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, or telecommunications networks, causing outages, downtime, or physical damage.
- **Data Exfiltration and Espionage**:
  - Attackers can leverage compromised hardware to exfiltrate sensitive data, intellectual property, or classified information, resulting in severe economic, national security, or competitive impacts.
- **Evasion of Security Measures**:
  - Hardware-level compromises bypass traditional endpoint security solutions, antivirus software, and network-based detection methods, making detection and remediation significantly more challenging.
- **High Cost and Complexity of Remediation**:
  - Remediation may require physical replacement or extensive re-validation of hardware across affected environments, incurring high financial costs and operational disruption.

Detecting this sub-technique early significantly reduces potential damages, limits attacker dwell time, and minimizes long-term impacts on victim organizations.

## Examples

Real-world examples highlighting the use and impact of hardware supply chain compromise include:

- **Supermicro "Big Hack" Allegations (2018)**:
  - Alleged insertion of malicious microchips into Supermicro server motherboards during manufacturing.
  - Claimed to enable attackers to remotely access and exfiltrate data from compromised servers.
  - Resulted in significant scrutiny of hardware supply chains, though the allegations remain disputed.
- **NSA ANT Catalog (2013)**:
  - Documented hardware implants used by the NSA for intelligence gathering and surveillance purposes.
  - Included hardware implants targeting networking equipment, servers, and peripheral devices to enable persistent, covert access.
- **Cisco Router Implant (Synful Knock, 2015)**:
  - Attackers compromised Cisco routers by implanting malicious firmware images.
  - Enabled backdoor access, data exfiltration, and persistent remote control of network infrastructure.
- **Equation Group Hard Disk Firmware Implants (2015)**:
  - Advanced persistent threat (APT) group implanted malicious firmware into hard disk drives from major manufacturers.
  - Allowed persistent, stealthy access and data exfiltration that survived disk formatting and operating system reinstallation.
- **Raspberry Robin (2022)**:
  - Attackers leveraged malicious USB devices to deliver malware payloads and establish persistent footholds within targeted networks.
  - Demonstrated the continued relevance and effectiveness of compromised peripheral devices as attack vectors.

These examples highlight the sophistication, persistence, and potential damage associated with hardware-based supply chain compromises, emphasizing the importance of proactive detection and mitigation strategies.

# JavaScript [T1059.007]

## Information

- Name: JavaScript
- ID: T1059.007
- Tactics: [TA0002](../TA0002/TA0002.md)
- Technique: [T1059](./T1059.md)

## Introduction

JavaScript [T1059.007] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework categorized under the broader technique "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059). It involves adversaries leveraging JavaScript scripts and interpreters to perform malicious operations, execute arbitrary commands, or facilitate further compromise within targeted systems. JavaScript is commonly utilized due to its widespread availability, ease of use, and the ability to execute in various runtime environments, including web browsers and standalone interpreters.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries exploit JavaScript in multiple ways, leveraging its flexibility, ubiquity, and ability to interact directly with system components or network resources. The following points detail the technical aspects and execution mechanisms:

- **Browser-Based Execution:**

  - Malicious JavaScript embedded within compromised websites or malicious advertisements (malvertising).
  - Exploitation of browser vulnerabilities through crafted JavaScript payloads.
  - Execution of scripts in browser extensions or plugins to gain persistence or perform reconnaissance.

- **Standalone JavaScript Execution via Interpreters (Node.js, Windows Script Host):**

  - Execution of malicious JavaScript files (.js) using Windows Script Host (WSH) through commands such as `wscript.exe` or `cscript.exe`.
  - Leveraging Node.js runtime environments installed on compromised hosts to execute scripts performing reconnaissance, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

- **Obfuscation and Evasion Techniques:**

  - Encoding or obfuscating scripts using Base64, hexadecimal encoding, or custom algorithms to evade detection.
  - Dynamically generating scripts at runtime to bypass static analysis and signature-based detection mechanisms.

- **Integration with Other Techniques:**
  - JavaScript scripts commonly interact with other techniques such as phishing (T1566), exploitation for client execution (T1203), and command-and-control (C2) frameworks (T1071).
  - Scripts may download additional payloads, execute shell commands, or interact with system APIs directly.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Adversaries frequently use JavaScript [T1059.007] across various stages and scenarios in cyber-attacks, including:

- **Initial Access:**

  - Embedded malicious JavaScript in phishing emails or compromised websites to exploit browser vulnerabilities and gain initial foothold.

- **Execution and Persistence:**

  - Scripts executed through Windows Script Host or Node.js to maintain persistence and execute commands regularly without user intervention.

- **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**

  - JavaScript scripts used to exploit vulnerabilities, escalate privileges, or disable security tools through automated scripting.

- **Credential Access and Reconnaissance:**

  - Scripts executed in browsers to harvest credentials, cookies, or perform reconnaissance against internal networks and resources.

- **Lateral Movement and Command-and-Control:**

  - JavaScript-based C2 agents or scripts facilitating lateral movement by interacting with internal network resources or executing commands remotely.

- **Exfiltration:**
  - JavaScript scripts performing data collection, encoding, and exfiltration via HTTP(S) requests or DNS tunneling methods.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of JavaScript [T1059.007] involves multiple layers and methodologies, including:

- **Endpoint Detection:**

  - Monitoring execution of suspicious JavaScript files via Windows Script Host (`wscript.exe`, `cscript.exe`) or Node.js processes.
  - Analyzing process command-line arguments and parent-child relationships for unusual JavaScript execution patterns.

- **Network Monitoring and Analysis:**

  - Detecting unusual outbound HTTP(S) traffic patterns originating from JavaScript execution contexts.
  - Monitoring DNS requests indicative of DNS tunneling or data exfiltration attempts.

- **Behavioral and Signature-based Detection:**

  - Utilizing antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions capable of identifying known malicious scripts and behaviors.
  - Employing sandboxing and behavioral analysis tools to detect anomalous script execution behaviors.

- **Script Analysis and Logging:**

  - Logging Windows Script Host and Node.js script execution events, including script paths, parameters, and timestamps.
  - Analyzing browser logs or extension activities for suspicious JavaScript execution or injection attempts.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Suspicious JavaScript filenames or file paths.
  - Unusual JavaScript execution commands, such as:
    - `wscript.exe malicious.js`
    - `node suspicious_script.js`
  - Encoded or obfuscated JavaScript payloads detected in logs or file systems.
  - Unrecognized browser extensions or injected scripts within browser profiles.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early and effective detection of malicious JavaScript execution is crucial due to the following potential impacts:

- **Initial Compromise and Exploitation:**

  - Malicious JavaScript can exploit browser or system vulnerabilities, facilitating initial access and compromise of the host.

- **Persistence and Stealthy Operations:**

  - JavaScript scripts can establish persistence mechanisms, allowing adversaries prolonged and undetected access to compromised systems.

- **Credential Harvesting and Sensitive Data Theft:**

  - Scripts executed in browser contexts can collect sensitive information, credentials, cookies, and session tokens, leading to account compromise and unauthorized access.

- **Lateral Movement and Network Reconnaissance:**

  - JavaScript scripts can automate reconnaissance activities, lateral movement, and internal network scanning, significantly expanding the attack surface.

- **Data Exfiltration and Command-and-Control:**
  - Malicious scripts can encode and exfiltrate sensitive data through stealthy channels such as HTTP(S) or DNS, complicating detection and incident response efforts.

Overall, prompt detection reduces attacker dwell time, minimizes damage, and aids rapid containment and remediation efforts.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of JavaScript [T1059.007] in cyber-attacks include:

- **Magecart Attacks (Web Skimming):**

  - Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into e-commerce websites to capture payment card information entered by customers at checkout.
  - Scripts silently exfiltrate captured data to attacker-controlled servers, resulting in significant financial and reputational damage.

- **Emotet Malware Campaigns:**

  - Emotet operators have utilized JavaScript files delivered via phishing emails to execute malicious payloads.
  - Victims receive emails containing JavaScript attachments that, when executed, download and install additional malware such as banking trojans or ransomware.

- **FIN7 Group Attacks:**

  - FIN7 leveraged JavaScript-based payloads delivered via phishing emails and malicious documents to execute reconnaissance and deploy backdoors.
  - JavaScript scripts executed via Windows Script Host facilitated initial access and subsequent lateral movement within targeted networks.

- **Gootloader Malware:**

  - Gootloader campaigns distribute JavaScript-based malware through compromised websites appearing in search engine results.
  - Victims download and execute malicious JavaScript files, leading to installation of additional malware payloads and persistence mechanisms.

- **Operation ShadowHammer (ASUS Supply Chain Attack):**
  - Attackers injected malicious JavaScript code into legitimate software updates, compromising ASUS software distribution channels.
  - Malicious JavaScript executed on victim systems, facilitating reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and targeted exploitation.

These examples underscore the versatility, effectiveness, and widespread usage of JavaScript-based attacks across diverse industries and threat actor groups.

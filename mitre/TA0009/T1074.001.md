# Local Data Staging [T1074.001]

## Information

- Name: Local Data Staging
- ID: T1074.001
- Tactics: [TA0009](../TA0009/TA0009.md)
- Technique: [T1074](./T1074.md)

## Introduction

Local Data Staging (T1074.001) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework categorized under Data Staged (T1074). It involves adversaries collecting and temporarily storing data locally on compromised systems prior to exfiltration. Attackers often stage data locally to consolidate information, compress or encrypt it, and prepare it for transfer, thus minimizing exposure and reducing the likelihood of detection during the exfiltration phase.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Local Data Staging encompasses various methods adversaries use to temporarily store stolen or collected data on compromised systems before exfiltration. The process typically involves:

- **Data Collection and Aggregation:**

  - Attackers first identify and collect sensitive or valuable data, such as documents, databases, emails, intellectual property, or user credentials.
  - Data is aggregated into a centralized location, typically a hidden or obscure directory within the compromised host.

- **Compression and Encryption:**

  - Adversaries frequently compress data into archives (ZIP, RAR, TAR, or 7z) to reduce file size and facilitate quicker exfiltration.
  - Encryption may also be used to obfuscate the data, making it harder for defenders to detect and analyze the contents.

- **Temporary Storage Locations:**

  - Adversaries commonly stage data in directories that blend with the operating system's legitimate file structure, such as:
    - Temporary directories (`%TEMP%`, `/tmp`)
    - User profile directories (`%USERPROFILE%`, `/home/user/`)
    - Hidden directories or files (prefixed with a dot on Unix-based systems, or using system attributes on Windows)
  - Attackers may also use random or misleading filenames to evade suspicion.

- **Preparation for Exfiltration:**
  - Once data is staged locally, attackers assess the safest and most efficient method for exfiltration, considering network monitoring, detection mechanisms, and available protocols.
  - Data may be segmented into smaller files or encrypted to evade traditional network monitoring tools.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Local Data Staging is typically employed by adversaries in multiple phases of an attack lifecycle, including:

- **Collection Phase:**

  - After initial compromise and reconnaissance, attackers gather sensitive information from compromised systems and stage it locally for later exfiltration.

- **Exfiltration Phase:**

  - Immediately preceding data exfiltration, attackers consolidate data to minimize transmission time and reduce network visibility.

- **Persistence and Long-Term Operations:**
  - During advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, attackers may periodically stage data locally over extended periods before exfiltration, allowing them to manage risk and maintain stealth.

Common attack scenarios include:

- Espionage operations targeting intellectual property or sensitive corporate documents.
- Ransomware attacks collecting sensitive data for double-extortion schemes.
- Financially motivated attackers collecting credentials or financial information.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Local Data Staging involves monitoring and analyzing system and file-level activities, utilizing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and behavioral analytics. Effective detection methods include:

- **File System Monitoring:**

  - Monitoring unusual file creation, modification, or deletion activities in temporary directories or user profile folders.
  - Detecting unexpected compressed or encrypted file archives appearing in user or system directories.

- **Endpoint Behavioral Analysis:**

  - Behavioral analytics to detect anomalous patterns of data access, file manipulation, and command-line execution indicative of staging activities.
  - Observing processes associated with compression or encryption utilities (e.g., ZIP, 7z, RAR) that are executed by unusual parent processes or users.

- **Audit Logging and SIEM Correlation:**

  - Correlating file access logs with suspicious user activities or unusual login times.
  - Monitoring for the use of command-line tools (e.g., `tar`, `zip`, `rar`, `7z`) in unusual contexts or by unauthorized users.

- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Presence of unexpected compressed archives or encrypted files in temporary directories.
  - Unusual file naming conventions or file extensions (e.g., random strings, uncommon file extensions).
  - Evidence of scripting or command-line utilities used for data aggregation and compression.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Local Data Staging is critical due to its direct relationship with data exfiltration and potential data breaches. Importance of detection includes:

- **Preventing Data Loss:**

  - Identifying staging behaviors early allows security teams to intervene before sensitive data leaves the network.

- **Reducing Impact and Damage:**

  - Early detection minimizes the potential financial, operational, compliance, and reputational consequences associated with data breaches.

- **Identifying Ongoing Attacks:**

  - Detecting local data staging can reveal active intrusions, enabling incident response teams to contain and remediate threats swiftly.

- **Improving Security Posture:**
  - Understanding how adversaries stage data helps organizations enhance security controls, policies, and procedures to prevent similar attacks in the future.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Local Data Staging include:

- **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**

  - Known to stage stolen emails and sensitive documents locally in compressed archives before exfiltration.
  - Utilized legitimate compression tools (`7-Zip`) and custom scripts to aggregate and compress data, minimizing detection risk.

- **FIN7 Group:**

  - Financially motivated attackers staged payment card information and customer data locally on compromised point-of-sale (POS) systems.
  - Used custom malware tools and scripts to compress and encrypt data, staging it in hidden directories before exfiltration.

- **DarkSide Ransomware:**

  - Attackers staged sensitive corporate data locally, compressed it into archives, and encrypted it for double-extortion ransom demands.
  - Data was typically staged in temporary directories or obscure file paths to evade detection prior to exfiltration.

- **Equifax Breach (2017):**
  - Attackers staged personally identifiable information (PII) locally on compromised systems, compressing and encrypting large datasets before exfiltrating them.
  - Data staging activities were concealed in hidden directories, complicating detection and response efforts.

These examples highlight the diversity of adversaries and scenarios where Local Data Staging is leveraged, emphasizing the importance of proactive detection and response measures.

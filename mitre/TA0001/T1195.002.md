# Compromise Software Supply Chain

## Information

- Name: Compromise Software Supply Chain
- ID: T1195.002
- Tactics: [TA0001](../TA0001/TA0001.md)
- Technique: [T1195](T1195.md)

## Introduction

The Compromise Software Supply Chain sub-technique (T1195.002) in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework refers to adversaries manipulating or exploiting software distribution mechanisms and supply chains to deliver malicious payloads. Attackers typically compromise legitimate software or software update channels, embedding malware or backdoors that are unknowingly distributed to end-users. This sub-technique allows attackers to bypass traditional security mechanisms, as users inherently trust legitimate software sources, increasing the likelihood of successful infiltration and persistence.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employing the Compromise Software Supply Chain sub-technique typically follow a structured approach involving multiple technical steps:

- **Initial Compromise of Software Vendor or Distributor:**
  - Attackers target software vendors or third-party distribution channels through spear phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or credential theft.
  - Common entry methods include exploiting web application vulnerabilities, compromised credentials, or insider threats within the vendor organization.
- **Manipulation of Software or Updates:**
  - Once access is achieved, adversaries inject malicious code into legitimate software builds or updates.
  - Malicious payloads may include remote access trojans (RATs), backdoors, ransomware, or data exfiltration tools.
  - Attackers often use obfuscation techniques and carefully integrate malicious code to evade detection.
- **Distribution and Delivery:**
  - The compromised software or updates are digitally signed and distributed via official channels, such as vendor websites, auto-update services, or third-party repositories.
  - Victims unknowingly install the compromised software, trusting the legitimate source and signed binaries.
- **Execution and Persistence:**
  - Upon installation, malicious payloads execute silently, establishing persistence mechanisms such as scheduled tasks, registry modifications, or service creation.
  - Attackers leverage legitimate software processes and services to mask malicious activities and evade endpoint detection.
- **Command and Control (C2) Communications:**
  - Malicious software establishes communication channels with attacker-controlled infrastructure for command execution, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within victim networks.
  - C2 channels often use encrypted protocols (HTTPS, DNS tunneling, or custom protocols) to avoid detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Adversaries typically utilize the Compromise Software Supply Chain sub-technique in the following attack scenarios and stages:

- **Initial Access and Infiltration:**
  - Attackers rely on compromised software and updates as initial entry vectors to gain footholds in targeted organizations.
  - Organizations that regularly update or install trusted software become unwitting victims.
- **Espionage and Cybercrime Campaigns:**
  - Nation-state threat actors often use this technique for espionage operations, targeting sensitive government, military, or corporate networks.
  - Cybercriminals leverage compromised software supply chains to distribute ransomware, banking trojans, or credential-stealing malware.
- **Targeting High-Value or Secure Environments:**
  - Highly secure environments or air-gapped networks are often targeted through compromised software supply chains, as traditional attack vectors (phishing, direct exploitation) may fail.
  - Attackers exploit the implicit trust placed by users in legitimate software vendors, bypassing stringent security controls.
- **Large-Scale Campaigns:**
  - Attackers use this technique to target a wide range of victims simultaneously, as compromised software updates reach numerous users quickly and efficiently.
  - Attackers achieve widespread infiltration without the need for individually tailored attack vectors.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of compromised software supply chains requires a combination of proactive monitoring, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence:

- **Integrity Verification and Hash Validation:**
  - Regularly verify software hashes and digital signatures against official vendor-provided values.
  - Utilize file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized modifications in software binaries and updates.
- **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions identify anomalous software behaviors, such as unusual network connections, unexpected file modifications, or abnormal process spawning.
  - Network monitoring tools detect suspicious outbound communications, unusual traffic patterns, or DNS anomalies indicative of C2 communications.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:**
  - Leverage threat intelligence feeds and advisories from trusted sources (e.g., CERTs, vendor security notices) to detect known compromised software or malicious infrastructure.
  - Implement proactive vulnerability management and patching processes to mitigate exploitation risks.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Suspicious file hashes or digital signatures not matching official vendor records.
  - Unusual network traffic patterns, including connections to unknown or suspicious domains/IP addresses.
  - Anomalous registry entries, scheduled tasks, or services created by software updates.
  - Unexpected persistence mechanisms or modifications to critical system files and processes.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of compromised software supply chains is crucial due to the significant impacts and risks associated with this sub-technique:

- **Widespread Impact and Rapid Propagation:**
  - Compromised software updates can rapidly reach numerous users, significantly amplifying the scale and impact of the attack.
  - Early detection enables rapid containment and mitigates widespread infection across multiple organizations or sectors.
- **Bypassing Traditional Security Controls:**
  - Users inherently trust legitimate software vendors and updates, making it easier for attackers to bypass traditional perimeter defenses, antivirus, and endpoint security solutions.
  - Timely detection prevents attackers from leveraging this inherent trust, reducing the likelihood of successful infiltration.
- **Severe Operational and Financial Consequences:**
  - Compromised software supply chains can lead to severe operational disruptions, data breaches, intellectual property theft, and financial losses.
  - Early identification and containment minimize downtime, financial impact, and reputational damage.
- **Long-Term Persistence and Espionage:**
  - Attackers often use compromised software supply chains to establish long-term persistence, enabling espionage or intellectual property theft over extended periods.
  - Detection and remediation disrupt adversary footholds, preventing prolonged unauthorized access and exfiltration activities.

# Exploit Public-Facing Application

## Information

- Name: Exploit Public-Facing Application
- ID: T1190
- Tactics: [TA0001](../TA0001/TA0001.md)

## Introduction

Exploit Public-Facing Application is a technique listed in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework (Technique ID: T1190), categorized under Initial Access. This technique involves attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications or services to gain unauthorized access into systems or networks. Attackers commonly target web servers, databases, VPN gateways, or any externally accessible services that have known or unknown vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities provides attackers with an initial foothold, enabling further lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence within the compromised environment.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers exploit public-facing applications primarily through the following technical approaches:

- **Web Application Attacks**:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi): Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into input fields, exploiting improper input validation to retrieve sensitive data or gain administrative access.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts injected into legitimate web pages, potentially stealing user credentials or session cookies.
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI): Attackers exploit improper file handling to execute malicious code or access sensitive files.
  - Command Injection: Exploiting improper validation of user input to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.
- **Vulnerability Exploitation of Public Services**:
  - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS), CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Drupal), VPN gateways, remote desktop protocols (RDP), email servers, and other externally accessible services.
  - Leveraging outdated or unpatched software versions with publicly available exploits.
- **Zero-Day Exploits**:
  - Exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities for which no patches or mitigations exist at the time of attack.
  - Often leveraged by advanced persistent threats (APTs) or sophisticated threat actors.
- **Exploit Kits and Automated Tools**:
  - Use of exploit kits (e.g., RIG, Angler, Magnitude) and automated scanning tools (e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to identify and exploit vulnerabilities quickly and efficiently.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This technique is commonly observed at the initial stages of cyber-attacks, primarily serving as the entry point for attackers into targeted networks. Typical scenarios and stages include:

- **Initial Access**:
  - Attackers scan externally facing services for known vulnerabilities.
  - Automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning to identify exploitable targets.
- **Credential Harvesting and Data Theft**:
  - Attackers exploit vulnerable web applications to steal user credentials, sensitive data, or confidential information.
- **Establishing Persistence and Foothold**:
  - Attackers exploit public-facing applications to deploy web shells, backdoors, or remote administration tools, enabling persistent access.
- **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation**:
  - Once initial access is established, attackers leverage compromised web applications to pivot internally, escalating privileges and moving laterally within the network.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**:
  - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to compromise servers, turning them into bots or command-and-control nodes for launching large-scale DDoS attacks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods for exploitation of public-facing applications often involve a combination of proactive monitoring, threat intelligence, and security tools, including:

- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**:
  - Detect and block malicious traffic patterns indicative of SQL injection, XSS, and other web-based attacks.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**:
  - Identify known exploit signatures, anomalous traffic patterns, and suspicious payloads.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**:
  - Correlation and analysis of logs from web servers, firewalls, IDS, and other security tools to detect signs of compromise.
- **Vulnerability Scanners**:
  - Regular scanning of public-facing applications to detect known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before attackers exploit them.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  - Monitor endpoint behaviors and file activities indicative of exploitation attempts or successful breaches.
- **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)**:
  - Detection of unusual network traffic patterns, unusual outbound connections, or suspicious data exfiltration activities from public-facing systems.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

- Web access logs showing suspicious requests or exploitation attempts (e.g., SQL injection attempts, command injection payloads).
- Unexpected web shells or unfamiliar files appearing on web servers.
- Anomalous outbound network connections from public-facing servers to unknown IP addresses.
- Unusual spikes in resource usage (CPU, memory, bandwidth) on public-facing servers.
- Unauthorized configuration changes or new user accounts created on public-facing systems.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of exploits targeting public-facing applications is critical due to the potential severe impacts, including:

- **Data Breach and Data Loss**:
  - Attackers can extract sensitive information such as personal identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, confidential business data, or financial records.
- **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation**:
  - Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized administrative access, enabling attackers to escalate privileges and compromise other internal systems.
- **Operational Disruption**:
  - Compromised applications may be rendered unavailable or unstable, leading to downtime and interruption of critical business operations.
- **Reputation Damage**:
  - Public disclosure of breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation, resulting in loss of customer trust, legal consequences, and regulatory penalties.
- **Financial Impact**:
  - Costs associated with incident response, remediation, regulatory fines, legal fees, and potential loss of business revenue.

Early detection helps organizations:

- Minimize damage and reduce the attack surface.
- Quickly remediate vulnerabilities and prevent further exploitation.
- Strengthen security posture and improve overall resilience against future attacks.

## Examples

Real-world examples of exploitation of public-facing applications include:

- **Equifax Data Breach (2017)**:
  - Vulnerability exploited: Apache Struts framework (CVE-2017-5638).
  - Attackers exploited unpatched Struts vulnerability on a public web application, compromising sensitive personal data of approximately 147 million consumers.
  - Impact: Massive data breach, severe financial and reputational damage, regulatory fines, and lawsuits.
- **Pulse Secure VPN Exploitation (2019-2020)**:
  - Vulnerabilities exploited: CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-11539.
  - Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN servers to gain unauthorized access, install web shells, and compromise internal networks.

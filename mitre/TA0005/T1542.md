## Introduction

Pre-OS Boot techniques, as classified under MITRE ATT&CK (T1542), involve adversaries executing malicious code or modifying system components before the operating system fully boots. Such methods allow attackers to maintain persistence, evade detection, and establish deep-rooted control over compromised systems. These techniques primarily target firmware, bootloaders, and other pre-operating system components to ensure malicious code execution at the earliest stages of system startup.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Pre-OS Boot attacks exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system boot process, firmware, or hardware initialization routines. Attackers typically leverage the following methods:

- **Firmware Modification:**

  - Manipulating BIOS or UEFI firmware to embed malicious code.
  - Utilizing firmware rootkits to persistently infect systems, surviving OS reinstallations or disk replacements.

- **Bootloader Manipulation:**

  - Altering bootloader code (e.g., GRUB, Windows Boot Manager) to execute malicious payloads before the OS loads.
  - Injecting code into boot sectors or EFI partitions.

- **Hardware-Level Attacks:**

  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware components (chipsets, TPM, storage controllers) to execute malicious instructions pre-boot.
  - Using compromised hardware or firmware implants to subvert system security.

- **Secure Boot Bypass:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to bypass secure boot mechanisms, enabling unauthorized code execution at boot time.
  - Employing stolen or compromised signing keys to sign malicious bootloaders or firmware.

Real-world procedures typically involve:

- Gaining initial system access through phishing, supply chain compromise, or physical access.
- Escalating privileges to modify firmware or bootloader components.
- Installing persistent implants or rootkits to ensure stealth and longevity.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ Pre-OS Boot techniques in the following scenarios and stages of an attack:

- **Persistence Stage:**

  - To maintain long-term, stealthy persistence that survives OS reinstallation, system updates, and security software scans.

- **Privilege Escalation:**

  - To escalate privileges by controlling system boot processes and firmware-level operations, enabling attackers to bypass OS-level security controls.

- **Defense Evasion:**

  - To evade detection by security solutions that typically operate at OS-level, as pre-OS boot code executes before security tools are active.

- **Supply Chain Attacks:**

  - Embedding malicious firmware or bootloader modifications during hardware manufacturing or software distribution processes.

- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Operations:**

  - Leveraging pre-OS malware to maintain persistent access in high-value targets, including government agencies, critical infrastructure, and large enterprises.

- **Physical Access Scenarios:**
  - Exploiting systems where an attacker has temporary physical access, enabling direct firmware manipulation or bootloader tampering.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Pre-OS Boot compromises typically requires specialized methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Firmware Integrity Checks:**

  - Regularly verifying firmware integrity through cryptographic hashes, secure boot procedures, and firmware attestation tools.

- **Bootloader Monitoring:**

  - Analyzing bootloader configurations, boot sectors, EFI partitions, and monitoring for unauthorized modifications or anomalies.

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM) and TPMs:**

  - Utilizing Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) or hardware security modules to detect deviations from expected boot measurements and firmware states.

- **UEFI Scanning Tools:**

  - Employing specialized tools such as CHIPSEC, UEFITool, or ESET UEFI Scanner to detect malicious firmware implants or unauthorized code injections.

- **Behavioral Indicators:**

  - Unexpected system crashes or boot failures.
  - Unusual boot times or delays.
  - Unrecognized firmware version numbers or unexpected firmware updates.

- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Unknown or unsigned firmware images.
  - Suspicious EFI binaries or bootloader files.
  - Unusual firmware or bootloader configurations detected in logs.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Pre-OS Boot techniques is critical due to their severe impact on systems and networks:

- **High-Level Persistence:**

  - Malicious firmware implants or bootloader modifications persist across OS reinstallation, disk replacement, and routine security updates, making remediation challenging.

- **Stealth and Evasion:**

  - Pre-OS malware executes before OS-level security controls are active, significantly reducing detection chances and allowing attackers prolonged undetected presence.

- **Privilege Escalation and Control:**

  - Attackers gain comprehensive control over system initialization, enabling high-level privilege escalation and potential system compromise at the deepest hardware and firmware levels.

- **Integrity and Availability Risks:**

  - Malicious pre-OS code can compromise system integrity, causing instability, data corruption, or denial-of-service conditions.

- **Supply Chain Risks:**
  - Pre-OS attacks embedded during manufacturing or distribution can affect large-scale deployments, impacting numerous systems simultaneously.

Early detection and mitigation of Pre-OS Boot compromises are essential to prevent long-term damage, reduce remediation costs, and maintain system integrity and trustworthiness.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Pre-OS Boot attacks include:

- **LoJax UEFI Rootkit (APT28):**

  - **Attack Scenario:** Russian-linked threat actor APT28 compromised UEFI firmware to install LoJax, establishing persistent access on targeted systems.
  - **Tools Used:** LoJax malware, firmware flashing tools, compromised legitimate utilities.
  - **Impact:** Persistent, stealthy infection surviving OS reinstallations, enabling long-term espionage operations.

- **MosaicRegressor UEFI Malware (APT41):**

  - **Attack Scenario:** Chinese-linked APT41 utilized MosaicRegressor, a malicious UEFI implant, to target diplomatic entities.
  - **Tools Used:** MosaicRegressor malware, firmware exploitation, and modification tools.
  - **Impact:** Persistent espionage campaigns with deep system-level access, difficult to detect and remediate.

- **TrickBoot Module (TrickBot Malware):**

  - **Attack Scenario:** TrickBot operators developed TrickBoot to inspect UEFI firmware vulnerabilities, potentially enabling firmware-level persistence.
  - **Tools Used:** TrickBot malware framework, TrickBoot module.
  - **Impact:** Potential for firmware-level persistence, significantly complicating remediation and detection efforts.

- **Sednit Group (APT28) Secure Boot Bypass:**
  - **Attack Scenario:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Secure Boot implementations to load unsigned malicious bootloaders.
  - **Tools Used:** Custom bootloader modifications, exploitation of Secure Boot vulnerabilities.
  - **Impact:** Complete bypass of fundamental security controls, enabling persistent, stealthy malware execution.

These examples illustrate the severity and persistence potential of Pre-OS Boot attacks, highlighting the necessity for robust detection and mitigation strategies.

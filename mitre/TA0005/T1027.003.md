# Steganography

## Information

- Name: Steganography
- ID: T1027.003
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)
- Technique: [T1027](T1027.md)

## Introduction

Steganography (T1027.003) refers to a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027). Steganography involves hiding data within other non-secret data, such as embedding malicious payloads within images, audio files, video files, or even text documents. Attackers leverage steganography to evade detection by conventional security tools, as the hidden malicious content typically blends seamlessly with legitimate traffic and files, making it difficult to detect through standard analysis.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Steganography encompasses a variety of techniques and methods to conceal malicious payloads or covert messages:

- **Image-based steganography:**
  - Attackers embed malicious code or data within image files (PNG, JPEG, GIF) using least significant bit (LSB) encoding or manipulation of metadata.
  - Tools commonly used: OpenStego, Steghide, SilentEye, and custom scripts.
- **Audio-based steganography:**
  - Embedding payloads within audio files (MP3, WAV) by altering audio frequencies or embedding data in audio metadata.
  - Tools commonly used: MP3Stego, DeepSound, custom audio encoding scripts.
- **Video-based steganography:**
  - Hiding data within video streams by subtly modifying frames or embedding within metadata fields.
  - Tools commonly used: OpenPuff, custom scripts leveraging FFmpeg.
- **Text-based steganography:**
  - Concealing data in textual content through whitespace encoding, font manipulation, or subtle textual formatting (e.g., zero-width characters, Unicode tricks).
  - Tools commonly used: SNOW, custom scripts.
- **Protocol-based steganography:**
  - Embedding data within seemingly legitimate network protocols (DNS, HTTP headers, ICMP packets), making it appear as normal traffic.
  - Tools commonly used: DNSCat2, Iodine, custom-crafted network packets.

Attackers frequently combine steganography with encryption to further obfuscate malicious payloads, complicating detection and analysis.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Steganography is commonly employed at various stages of an attack lifecycle:

- **Initial Access and Delivery:**
  - Attackers may embed malicious payloads in innocuous-looking files (images, audio files) delivered via phishing emails, social media platforms, or legitimate file-sharing services.
- **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
  - Attackers leverage steganographic techniques to hide C2 communications within legitimate network traffic, thereby evading detection by network security monitoring tools.
- **Data Exfiltration:**
  - Attackers embed stolen sensitive data within images, audio, or video files to bypass detection mechanisms during data exfiltration stages.
- **Persistence and Lateral Movement:**
  - Attackers may hide scripts or payloads within benign files to maintain persistence or move laterally within compromised networks without triggering alerts.

Steganography is especially prevalent in advanced persistent threats (APTs) and sophisticated cyber espionage campaigns, where stealth and persistence are critical.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of steganographic techniques is challenging but achievable through a combination of methods:

- **File Integrity and Metadata Analysis:**
  - Tools that analyze metadata and file structures can identify anomalies or unexpected modifications (e.g., ExifTool, Foremost, binwalk).
- **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**
  - Network monitoring and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions can identify suspicious file access patterns, unusual network traffic, or unexpected file types being accessed or transferred.
- **Steganalysis Tools:**
  - Specialized steganalysis tools (StegExpose, StegDetect) can scan files for known signatures or anomalies indicative of steganographic embedding.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  - Monitoring for protocol anomalies or unusual DNS/HTTP traffic patterns can help detect protocol-based steganography.
- **Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis:**
  - Advanced machine learning models can detect subtle deviations in file structures or network traffic indicative of steganographic techniques.

Indicators of compromise (IoCs) often include:

- Unusual file sizes or unexpected metadata fields.
- Presence of steganography-related tools or artifacts on endpoints.
- Anomalous network traffic patterns, especially frequent DNS queries or HTTP requests with unusual headers.
- Files with unusual entropy levels or suspicious binary patterns.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of steganography is critical because:

- **Stealth and Evasion:**
  - Steganography enables attackers to bypass traditional detection mechanisms, significantly increasing the likelihood of successful attacks and long-term persistence.
- **Data Exfiltration Risks:**
  - Attackers may leverage steganography to covertly exfiltrate sensitive or proprietary data, potentially causing significant financial, operational, or reputational damage.
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Activity:**
  - Steganographic techniques are commonly used by sophisticated threat actors and nation-state groups, indicating potential high-impact cyber espionage or sabotage operations.
- **Incident Response Complexity:**
  - Undetected steganography prolongs incident response and complicates forensic analysis, increasing remediation complexity and costs.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Impact:**
  - Failure to detect hidden malicious payloads or data exfiltration can lead to compliance violations, regulatory penalties, and loss of customer trust.

## Examples

Real-world examples of steganography-based attacks include:

- **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**
  - Leveraged steganography to hide malicious payloads within PNG images in phishing campaigns targeting government entities and private companies.
  - Impact: Enabled prolonged espionage activities and theft of sensitive information.
- **LokiBot Malware:**
  - Used image-based steganography to conceal malicious payloads within BMP image files distributed via phishing emails.
  - Impact: Credential theft, financial fraud, and persistent backdoor access.
- **OceanLotus (APT32):**
  - Employed steganography in documents and images to deliver malware payloads targeting Southeast Asian organizations.
  - Impact: Successful espionage operations, theft of intellectual property, and strategic information.
- **Invoke-PSImage Tool:**
  - A publicly available PowerShell-based tool allowing embedding of malicious scripts within image files, demonstrating ease of use and accessibility of steganographic methods.
  - Impact: Enabled attackers to bypass antivirus detection and execute malicious scripts undetected.
- **Turla Group:**
  - Utilized steganography within satellite-based internet links, embedding malicious C2 communication within legitimate satellite network traffic.
  - Impact: Enabled covert, long-term espionage operations against high-value targets.

These examples illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of steganography in real-world cyberattacks, highlighting the importance of proactive detection and mitigation strategies.

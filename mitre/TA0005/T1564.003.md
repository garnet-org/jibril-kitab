# Hidden Window

## Information

- Name: Hidden Window
- ID: T1564.003
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)
- Technique: [T1564](T1564.md)

## Introduction

Hidden Window (T1564.003) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework under the broader category of "Hide Artifacts" (T1564). Attackers leverage this technique by executing malicious programs or scripts in hidden windows, effectively concealing their activities from the victim and minimizing the likelihood of detection. By hiding windows from user interfaces, adversaries seek to maintain persistence, perform reconnaissance, and execute commands covertly without alerting the user or raising suspicion.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers utilizing the Hidden Window technique typically execute malicious payloads or scripts without displaying visible windows or user interface elements. This can be accomplished through several technical methods and mechanisms, including:

- **Windows API Functions**: Attackers can utilize Windows API calls such as `ShowWindow()` with parameters that hide windows (`SW_HIDE`) or minimize visibility (`SW_MINIMIZE`).
- **Scripting Languages**: PowerShell, VBScript, batch scripts, or JavaScript can be executed silently by employing command-line arguments or built-in functions designed to suppress window visibility.
- **Scheduled Tasks and Services**: Malicious actors may create scheduled tasks or Windows services configured to run without user interface interaction, ensuring hidden execution.
- **Third-party Utilities and Tools**: Attackers may leverage legitimate or malicious third-party tools that inherently support hidden execution modes, such as PsExec, PowerShell Empire, Metasploit, or custom-developed malware.
- **Registry Modifications**: Attackers may alter registry settings to launch applications silently or modify existing entries to execute programs without UI components.

Real-world procedures involve attackers embedding hidden-window execution within macro-enabled documents, phishing payloads, or malicious installers designed to run silently upon user interaction. These hidden windows allow attackers to execute commands, download additional payloads, or maintain persistent backdoors without alerting the victim.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly utilize the Hidden Window technique across various stages of an attack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access**:
  - Malicious email attachments or phishing links executing payloads silently.
  - Drive-by downloads or exploit kits delivering hidden payloads.
- **Execution**:
  - Running malicious scripts or binaries silently to prevent user detection.
  - Installation and execution of remote access tools (RATs) and backdoors without visible indicators.
- **Persistence**:
  - Scheduled tasks or services configured to run silently at system startup or user login.
  - Registry autorun entries that execute hidden scripts or binaries.
- **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion**:
  - Concealing privilege escalation attempts by silently executing scripts or binaries designed to elevate privileges.
  - Evading endpoint detection tools or antivirus by running hidden processes.
- **Command and Control (C2)**:
  - Establishing covert communication channels by running hidden windows that execute periodic callbacks or beaconing activities.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Hidden Window techniques involves multiple approaches, including behavioral analysis, endpoint monitoring, and log analysis. Common detection methods and tools include:

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions**:
  - Monitoring process creation events for unusual parameters or hidden execution flags (e.g., `SW_HIDE` parameter in API calls).
  - Detecting suspicious parent-child process relationships or processes executed without visible windows.
- **Sysmon and Windows Event Logs**:
  - Enabling Sysmon logging to capture detailed process execution events (Event ID 1) and analyze command-line arguments indicative of hidden execution.
  - Reviewing Windows Event Logs (Security, Application, and System logs) for unusual scheduled tasks, services, or registry modifications.
- **Behavioral Analytics and Threat Hunting**:
  - Identifying anomalous behaviors, such as scripts or binaries running silently without user interaction.
  - Monitoring for unusual network connections or file system activities initiated by hidden processes.
- **Process Monitoring Tools**:
  - Utilizing tools like Process Hacker, Process Monitor (ProcMon), or Autoruns to identify hidden or suspicious processes executing on the system.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Suspicious registry keys or scheduled task entries configured to run silently.
  - Unusual command-line arguments (`-WindowStyle Hidden`, `-w hidden`, `/silent`, `/quiet`) associated with PowerShell or script execution.
  - Unexpected binaries or scripts located in user directories or temporary folders executing silently.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Hidden Window techniques is crucial due to the potential severe impacts on systems and networks. Early detection provides several significant benefits:

- **Preventing Persistence and Lateral Movement**:
  - Early identification of hidden execution can prevent attackers from establishing persistent footholds or moving laterally within the environment.
- **Reducing Dwell Time**:
  - Prompt detection minimizes the time attackers remain undetected within the network, limiting the scope and scale of potential damage.
- **Mitigating Data Exfiltration and Espionage**:
  - Hidden windows often facilitate covert data exfiltration operations. Detecting these activities early helps prevent unauthorized data theft or intellectual property loss.
- **Protecting System Integrity**:
  - Hidden execution enables attackers to modify system configurations, escalate privileges, or install additional malware. Early detection helps preserve system and network integrity.
- **Enhancing Incident Response Capabilities**:
  - Detecting hidden execution events provides valuable context and evidence for incident responders, enabling rapid containment, remediation, and forensic analysis.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Hidden Window (T1564.003) usage include:

- **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  - Utilized PowerShell scripts executed silently (`-WindowStyle Hidden`) to establish persistence and download additional payloads during cyber espionage campaigns.
- **TrickBot Malware**:
  - Employed hidden windows and scheduled tasks to execute malicious payloads silently, enabling credential theft, lateral movement, and deployment of ransomware (Ryuk, Conti).
- **FIN7 Group**:
  - Leveraged JavaScript payloads executed silently via Windows Script Host (`wscript.exe`) to download and execute additional malware without user visibility.
- **Emotet Malware**:
  - Frequently executed PowerShell commands silently to download payloads, maintain persistence, and communicate with command-and-control servers.
- **Dridex Banking Trojan**:
  - Utilized hidden window execution of malicious payloads delivered via phishing emails to steal sensitive banking information and credentials.

In each of these examples, attackers leveraged hidden windows to conceal malicious activities, evade detection, and perform critical attack functions such as persistence, reconnaissance, credential theft, data exfiltration, and lateral movement.

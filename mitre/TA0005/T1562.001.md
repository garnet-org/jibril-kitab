# Disable or Modify Tools

## Information

- Name: Disable or Modify Tools
- ID: T1562.001
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)
- Technique: [T1562](T1562.md)

## Introduction

"Disable or Modify Tools" (T1562.001) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework's "Impair Defenses" (T1562) tactic. The purpose of this sub-technique is to prevent security tools and software from detecting malicious activities by disabling, tampering with, or modifying their functionality. Attackers frequently execute this technique to evade detection, maintain persistence, and facilitate subsequent stages of their intrusion, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employing T1562.001 typically aim to neutralize security mechanisms by disabling or modifying critical security tools. Common targets include antivirus (AV) software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), host-based firewalls, logging services, and system monitoring utilities.

Attackers may leverage multiple methods to disable or modify security tools, including:

- **Stopping or disabling security services:**
  - Utilizing built-in operating system tools such as `sc.exe`, `net stop`, or PowerShell commands (`Stop-Service`, `Set-Service -StartupType Disabled`) to disable or stop security-related services.
  - Manipulating Windows registry entries to prevent security services from starting automatically on system boot.
- **Altering or deleting configuration files:**
  - Modifying configuration files of security solutions to weaken detection capabilities or disable specific protective features.
  - Deleting or corrupting configuration files to render security tools ineffective.
- **Process termination:**
  - Using task management utilities (e.g., `taskkill`, PowerShell scripts) to terminate security-related processes.
  - Employing scripts or custom malware designed explicitly to identify and terminate security product processes.
- **Tampering with scheduled tasks:**
  - Disabling or deleting scheduled tasks responsible for regular updates, scans, or monitoring activities.
- **Driver modifications:**
  - Installing malicious drivers to intercept and block communication between security software components.
  - Removing or replacing legitimate drivers associated with security tools.
- **File or directory permissions modification:**
  - Changing file system permissions to prevent security solutions from accessing or executing necessary files or directories.

Attackers may employ these methods individually or in combination, depending on their objectives, privileges, and targeted security measures.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique can appear at various stages of an attack lifecycle, typically after initial access and privilege escalation have been achieved. Common scenarios include:

- **Initial compromise:**
  - Immediately after gaining initial access, attackers disable or modify security tools to avoid early detection and ensure the successful deployment of further payloads.
- **Privilege escalation and lateral movement:**
  - Attackers with administrative privileges disable security tools to facilitate lateral movement across the network without triggering alerts.
- **Persistence and defense evasion:**
  - Attackers modify security tool configurations or disable services to maintain long-term persistence and evade detection during long-term operations.
- **Data exfiltration and impact:**
  - Prior to data exfiltration or destructive actions, attackers disable security monitoring systems to prevent detection and response.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting T1562.001 involves monitoring for suspicious activities targeting security tools and their associated processes, services, and configurations. Detection methods include:

- **Endpoint monitoring and logging solutions:**
  - Monitor for unexpected stopping, disabling, or termination of security-related services and processes.
  - Track attempts to modify or delete security-related configuration files or registry entries.
- **File integrity monitoring (FIM):**
  - Implement FIM solutions to detect unauthorized changes or deletions of files associated with security tools and configurations.
- **Process monitoring and analysis:**
  - Monitor for suspicious command-line executions involving tools such as `sc.exe`, `net stop`, `taskkill`, or PowerShell commands targeting security processes.
- **Registry monitoring:**
  - Monitor registry changes related to security software startup entries, service configurations, or AV exclusions.
- **Event log analysis:**
  - Regularly analyze system, security, and application logs for unexpected service terminations, failed service restarts, or security tool errors.
- **Behavior-based detection:**
  - Advanced threat detection solutions (EDR/XDR) may detect behavioral anomalies, such as attempts to disable or modify security software.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) commonly associated with this technique include:

- Unexpected service stops or disabled states of AV, EDR, or firewall solutions.
- Unusual registry modifications related to security software.
- Suspicious command-line executions (e.g., `sc config`, `net stop`, `taskkill`, `powershell.exe -command Stop-Service`).
- Missing or corrupted security tool configuration files.
- Unauthorized changes in scheduled tasks related to security software updates or scans.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of T1562.001 is critical due to the significant impact it can have on organizational security posture. Failure to detect this technique promptly can result in:

- **Reduced visibility and detection capabilities:**
  - Attackers disabling security tools can operate undetected, significantly increasing dwell time within the environment.
- **Increased risk of persistence and lateral movement:**
  - Without effective security monitoring, attackers can establish persistent footholds and spread laterally across the network.
- **Facilitation of data exfiltration or destructive actions:**
  - Attackers can freely exfiltrate sensitive data or execute destructive payloads without triggering alarms or defensive responses.
- **Increased recovery costs and complexity:**
  - The longer attackers remain undetected, the more damage they can cause, leading to higher remediation costs and operational impact.
- **Compliance and regulatory implications:**
  - Disabling security tools may directly violate regulatory and compliance requirements, potentially leading to penalties, fines, or legal actions.

Detecting and responding rapidly to attempts to disable or modify security tools can significantly reduce attacker dwell time, limit damage, and help maintain organizational security and compliance.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of T1562.001 include:

- **TrickBot malware:**
  - TrickBot has been observed disabling Windows Defender by altering registry keys and disabling services, allowing subsequent payloads (such as ransomware) to execute without detection.
- **Ryuk ransomware:**
  - Ryuk ransomware operators often use scripts and batch files to disable antivirus and endpoint protection services before encrypting files. Commands such as `net stop` and `taskkill` are commonly used to terminate AV processes and services.
- **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**
  - APT29 has leveraged PowerShell commands and scripts to disable security tools and logging mechanisms, facilitating stealthy operations and long-term persistence in targeted networks.
- **FIN7 threat group:**
  - FIN7 has been observed disabling endpoint security tools by terminating processes or services and modifying registry settings to evade detection while conducting financial cybercrime activities.
- **Conti ransomware:**
  - Conti ransomware attackers utilize command scripts and PowerShell commands to disable antivirus software, firewall services, and endpoint detection solutions, ensuring successful ransomware deployment and data exfiltration.

In these examples, attackers consistently target security tools to reduce detection capabilities, maintain persistence, and maximize the impact of their operations.

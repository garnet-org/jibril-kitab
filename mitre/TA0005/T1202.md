# Indirect Command Execution [T1202]

## Information

- Name: Indirect Command Execution
- ID: T1202
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)

## Introduction

Indirect Command Execution is classified under the MITRE ATT&CK framework as technique T1202. It refers to attackers leveraging trusted, legitimate processes or applications, such as scripting interpreters, command-line utilities, or third-party software, to indirectly execute malicious commands or payloads. This technique helps adversaries evade detection by masking malicious activities within normal system operations or legitimate software behavior.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Indirect Command Execution typically involves the following technical mechanisms and execution methods:

- **Trusted System Utilities and Interpreters**

  - Attackers commonly exploit trusted Windows system utilities such as PowerShell, cmd.exe, wscript.exe, cscript.exe, rundll32.exe, regsvr32.exe, and mshta.exe.
  - Linux environments may involve bash scripts, cron jobs, python scripts, or legitimate binaries like wget, curl, or systemd services.

- **Third-party Application Exploitation**

  - Attackers use legitimate third-party applications such as web browsers, office productivity suites (Microsoft Office macros), PDF readers, or scripting frameworks to indirectly execute malicious commands.
  - Office macros or embedded scripts within documents can indirectly execute malicious payloads without directly invoking suspicious binaries.

- **Fileless Execution Methods**

  - Attackers may execute commands indirectly without writing payloads to disk, leveraging in-memory execution through scripting engines or PowerShell reflective loading.
  - Techniques such as reflective DLL injection or PowerShell's Invoke-Expression cmdlet are commonly used for indirect, stealthy execution.

- **Abuse of Legitimate Features**
  - Leveraging legitimate features such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Scheduled Tasks, Windows Services, or COM objects to indirectly execute commands or scripts.
  - Manipulating trusted processes by injecting malicious code into legitimate binaries or scripts.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Indirect Command Execution is frequently utilized in various stages and scenarios of cyber attacks, including:

- **Initial Access and Delivery**

  - Malicious documents containing macros or embedded scripts that indirectly execute payloads upon opening.
  - Drive-by downloads leveraging legitimate browser functionality or plugins.

- **Execution and Persistence**

  - Attackers establish persistent access by scheduling indirect command execution through legitimate scheduled tasks, services, or startup scripts.
  - Malicious scripts executed indirectly through legitimate interpreters to evade endpoint detection solutions.

- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**

  - Indirect execution via trusted utilities to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network without triggering security alerts.
  - Utilizing WMI or PowerShell remoting to execute commands indirectly on remote endpoints.

- **Defense Evasion**
  - Masking malicious activities by embedding commands within legitimate scripts or processes to bypass traditional antivirus and endpoint detection tools.
  - Using indirect execution techniques to evade application whitelisting or behavioral monitoring solutions.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Effective detection of Indirect Command Execution involves multiple layers of monitoring and analysis:

- **Process Monitoring and Behavioral Analysis**

  - Monitoring and alerting on unusual parent-child process relationships, such as office applications spawning cmd.exe, PowerShell, or scripting engines.
  - Identifying anomalous process execution patterns, including unusual command-line arguments or uncommon script execution.

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions**

  - EDR tools capable of detecting suspicious script execution, command-line parameters, and indirect command invocation through behavioral analytics.
  - Real-time detection of reflective DLL loading, memory-based execution, and suspicious use of scripting interpreters.

- **Logging and Auditing**

  - Comprehensive logging of PowerShell, WMI, and scripting engine activities (e.g., Script Block Logging, Module Logging).
  - Auditing scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and service creations for indirect command execution indicators.

- **Threat Intelligence and IoCs**
  - Leveraging known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as suspicious registry keys, scheduled tasks, specific command-line arguments, or known malicious scripts.
  - Utilizing threat intelligence feeds to correlate observed behaviors with known adversary TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

Specific IoCs include:

- Suspicious PowerShell commands like `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`, `DownloadString`, or encoded commands (`-EncodedCommand`).
- Abnormal usage of legitimate binaries (e.g., `regsvr32.exe` without DLL registration, or `mshta.exe` executing remote scripts).
- Unusual scheduled tasks or registry entries referencing scripts or indirect command execution methods.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Indirect Command Execution is critical due to its potentially severe impacts on systems and networks:

- **Evasion of Traditional Security Controls**

  - Indirect command execution often bypasses antivirus and signature-based detection, allowing attackers prolonged access without detection.

- **Persistence and Long-Term Compromise**

  - Attackers frequently use indirect execution techniques to establish persistent footholds, making remediation more difficult and costly.

- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**

  - Enables attackers to escalate privileges or move laterally within networks, significantly increasing the scope and severity of compromise.

- **Data Exfiltration and Damage**

  - Facilitates stealthy data exfiltration, espionage, and sabotage operations, potentially causing significant financial and reputational damage.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Risks**
  - Undetected indirect command execution can lead to regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), resulting in fines, penalties, and reputational harm.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating Indirect Command Execution include:

- **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**

  - Leveraged PowerShell and WMI for indirect command execution and lateral movement within compromised networks.
  - Utilized encoded PowerShell commands and reflective loading techniques to execute payloads indirectly and evade detection.

- **FIN7 Group**

  - Utilized malicious Microsoft Office macros embedded within documents to indirectly execute payloads through legitimate scripting engines.
  - Employed JavaScript and VBScript via wscript.exe and cscript.exe for stealthy command execution and persistence.

- **Emotet Malware**

  - Used indirect execution through malicious macros in Microsoft Office documents, invoking PowerShell scripts to download and execute additional payloads.
  - Frequently leveraged obfuscation and indirect execution methods to evade traditional antivirus solutions.

- **TrickBot Malware**

  - Employed indirect command execution via scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and legitimate Windows utilities (e.g., regsvr32.exe) to execute malicious payloads.
  - Utilized PowerShell and scripting interpreters to indirectly load malware into memory, avoiding detection by endpoint security tools.

- **Cobalt Strike Framework**
  - Attackers frequently use Cobalt Strike to indirectly execute commands via reflective DLL injection, PowerShell scripts, and legitimate Windows binaries.
  - Indirect command execution through trusted binaries and scripting languages enables attackers to evade detection and maintain persistent access.

# Bootkit [T1542.003]

## Information

- Name: Bootkit
- ID: T1542.003
- Tactics: [TA0003](../TA0003/TA0003.md), [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)
- Technique: [T1542](./T1542.md)

## Introduction

Bootkit [T1542.003] is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Persistence technique (T1542). Bootkits are malicious programs designed to infect the boot sectors or firmware of a victim's system, providing attackers with persistence and stealthy control over compromised systems. By embedding malicious code at an extremely low level, bootkits can execute before the operating system loads, making detection and removal challenging.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Bootkits typically operate by infecting the boot process of a computer system, enabling them to execute malicious code before the operating system (OS) fully initializes. This early execution provides attackers with a significant advantage, including the ability to bypass traditional antivirus and endpoint detection tools.

Key technical aspects of bootkits include:

- **Boot Sector Infection:**

  - Infecting Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR).
  - Modifying bootloader configurations to load malicious payloads prior to OS initialization.

- **UEFI/BIOS Infection:**

  - Targeting firmware interfaces such as Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Basic Input Output System (BIOS).
  - Leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in firmware to embed persistent malicious code.

- **Kernel-level Manipulation:**

  - Bootkits often inject rootkits at kernel-level, providing attackers with elevated privileges and stealth capabilities.
  - Hooking system calls and interrupt handlers to evade detection and maintain persistence.

- **Stealth and Persistence Mechanisms:**

  - Employing encryption, obfuscation, and polymorphic techniques to evade detection.
  - Ensuring persistence by re-infecting boot sectors or firmware even after OS reinstallation or disk formatting.

- **Common Infection Vectors:**
  - Malicious firmware updates.
  - Physical access attacks involving USB drives or bootable media.
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in firmware or bootloader software.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers often utilize bootkits in scenarios where long-term persistence, stealth, and deep-level system control are critical. Common attack scenarios and stages where bootkits appear include:

- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):**

  - Nation-state actors seeking prolonged, covert access to sensitive systems and critical infrastructure.

- **Cyber Espionage Operations:**

  - Gathering intelligence or stealing sensitive data from targeted organizations while remaining undetected.

- **Supply Chain Attacks:**

  - Compromising firmware or bootloader software during manufacturing or distribution processes, affecting multiple targets.

- **Targeted Attacks Against High-Value Assets:**

  - Attacks against critical infrastructure, government agencies, defense contractors, or financial institutions requiring persistent footholds.

- **Physical Access Attacks:**
  - Attackers with physical access to a device can install bootkits via bootable USB drives, external media, or firmware manipulation.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting bootkits can be challenging due to their low-level execution and stealth capabilities. However, several methods and tools can assist in identifying bootkit infections:

- **Integrity Checking and Verification:**

  - Regularly verifying the integrity of boot sectors, bootloaders, and firmware images against known-good baselines.
  - Utilizing tools such as TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and Secure Boot to detect unauthorized modifications.

- **Firmware Scanning Tools:**

  - Specialized firmware scanners and rootkit detection tools, such as CHIPSEC, ESET UEFI Scanner, and Kaspersky TDSSKiller, can detect anomalies in firmware and boot sectors.

- **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**

  - Monitoring boot times, unexpected system behavior, or unusual kernel-level calls can indicate bootkit presence.
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions capable of kernel-level monitoring and anomaly detection.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Unexpected modifications or corruption in MBR or VBR.
  - Suspicious firmware updates or firmware images with mismatched cryptographic signatures.
  - Presence of unknown or unauthorized bootloader entries.
  - Unusual system crashes or instability during the boot process.
  - Detection of unusual kernel modules or drivers loading early in the boot sequence.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting bootkits is critical due to their severe potential impacts on systems and networks. Importance of early detection includes:

- **Preventing Long-term Persistence:**

  - Early detection prevents attackers from establishing deep-rooted persistence that can survive OS reinstallation or disk wiping.

- **Mitigating Stealthy Operations:**

  - Bootkits enable attackers to operate covertly, allowing prolonged espionage, data theft, or sabotage activities.

- **Protecting System Integrity:**

  - Bootkits compromise fundamental system components, potentially causing instability, data corruption, or irreversible damage to hardware or firmware.

- **Reducing Remediation Costs:**

  - Early detection reduces the complexity, time, and cost associated with remediation efforts, as bootkit removal is often challenging and resource-intensive.

- **Preventing Data Exfiltration and Espionage:**

  - Detecting bootkits early limits attackers' ability to exfiltrate sensitive data or conduct espionage operations against targeted organizations.

- **Maintaining Regulatory Compliance:**
  - Organizations may face regulatory penalties or legal repercussions if bootkit infections lead to data breaches or system compromises.

## Examples

Several real-world examples demonstrate bootkit attacks, illustrating their sophistication, persistence, and potential impact:

- **LoJax UEFI Bootkit (APT28/Sednit Group):**

  - Attack Scenario: APT28, a Russian cyber espionage group, used LoJax, the first publicly documented UEFI bootkit, targeting government entities and organizations in Eastern Europe.
  - Tools Used: LoJax leveraged compromised versions of legitimate software (LoJack anti-theft software) to infect UEFI firmware.
  - Impact: Persistent, stealthy access and espionage capabilities, surviving OS reinstallation and disk replacement.

- **FinSpy Bootkit:**

  - Attack Scenario: FinSpy, a commercial spyware used by various state-sponsored actors, included bootkit capabilities to maintain persistence and evade detection.
  - Tools Used: FinSpy malware suite with bootkit functionality, infecting MBR and kernel-level components.
  - Impact: Persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and covert monitoring of targeted individuals and organizations.

- **ROCKBOOT (Chinese APT41 Group):**

  - Attack Scenario: Chinese cyber espionage group APT41 developed ROCKBOOT, a custom bootkit targeting firmware vulnerabilities to gain persistent access.
  - Tools Used: Custom UEFI bootkit leveraging firmware vulnerabilities and persistence mechanisms.
  - Impact: Long-term espionage capabilities, stealthy exfiltration of sensitive data, and difficulty of remediation due to firmware-level persistence.

- **Mebromi BIOS Rootkit:**
  - Attack Scenario: Mebromi infected BIOS firmware, MBR, and kernel-level components, making it particularly persistent and difficult to remove.
  - Tools Used: BIOS-level infection mechanisms combined with MBR and kernel-level rootkits.
  - Impact: Persistent control over infected systems, surviving OS reinstallation, and complicating remediation efforts.

These examples highlight the sophisticated nature of bootkits, their extensive persistence capabilities, and the critical importance of detection and mitigation measures.

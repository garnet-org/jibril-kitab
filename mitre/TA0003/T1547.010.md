# Port Monitors [T1547.010]

## Information

- Name: Port Monitors
- ID: T1547.010
- Tactics: [TA0003](../TA0003/TA0003.md), [TA0004](../TA0004/TA0004.md)
- Technique: [T1547](./T1547.md)

## Introduction

Port Monitors ([T1547.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010/)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" tactic. Attackers leverage port monitors, which are DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) loaded by the Windows Print Spooler service (`spoolsv.exe`), to establish persistent malicious code execution. Port monitors are typically used legitimately to manage printer ports and printing tasks. However, attackers abuse this functionality by registering malicious DLLs as port monitors, enabling automatic execution upon system startup or service restart.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Port monitors are DLLs that extend the functionality of the Windows Print Spooler service (`spoolsv.exe`). Legitimate port monitors handle communication between printers and the operating system. Windows maintains a registry key that lists these port monitors, and the spooler loads each DLL listed at system startup or spooler service restart.

Attackers exploit this behavior to achieve persistence by:

- Creating or modifying DLL files to contain malicious payloads.
- Registering their malicious DLLs under the registry key:

  ```
  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors
  ```

- Restarting the spooler service or waiting for system reboot to trigger automatic DLL loading and execution.

Technical details include:

- Malicious DLLs must implement specific exported functions (`InitializePrintMonitor2`, `OpenPort`, `ClosePort`, etc.) to avoid errors or crashes during spooler loading.
- Attackers may disguise their DLLs with legitimate-sounding names to evade detection.
- DLLs loaded as port monitors run under the context and permissions of the spooler service, typically with elevated SYSTEM privileges.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly utilize port monitors for persistence, particularly in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios where stealth and long-term presence are critical. Typical scenarios include:

- Post-exploitation phases: Attackers have already compromised a system and seek covert persistence.
- Privilege escalation scenarios: Leveraging spooler service privileges to maintain high-level access.
- Advanced targeted attacks: State-sponsored or sophisticated criminal groups aiming at long-term espionage, data exfiltration, or sabotage.

Stages in attack lifecycle where port monitors appear:

- Persistence: Ensuring malicious code execution survives system restarts and remains hidden.
- Defense evasion: Camouflaging malicious activity within legitimate system processes and services.
- Privilege escalation: Exploiting spooler service privileges to maintain elevated access.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malicious port monitors involves multiple methods:

- **Registry Monitoring**:

  - Monitor changes to registry keys related to port monitors:

    ```
    HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors
    ```

  - Tools: Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.

- **DLL Monitoring and Analysis**:

  - Regularly inspect DLLs registered as port monitors for unusual naming conventions, locations, or digital signatures.
  - Perform static and dynamic analysis of suspicious DLLs to identify malicious payloads.

- **Process Monitoring**:

  - Identify unusual behavior or network connections initiated by the spooler service (`spoolsv.exe`).
  - Tools: Process Monitor, Process Explorer, EDR solutions.

- **Behavioral Indicators**:
  - Unusual spooler crashes, errors, or restarts.
  - Unexpected network traffic originating from the spooler service.
  - Spooler service loading DLLs from non-standard directories.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

- Suspicious or unknown DLL files registered under the port monitors registry key.
- Unexpected registry modifications to port monitor keys.
- Spooler service initiating suspicious network communication.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of malicious port monitors is crucial due to the following potential impacts:

- **Persistence**: Malicious DLLs loaded as port monitors ensure attackers maintain long-term access, even after system reboots or user logoffs.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Port monitors run under the spooler service, typically with SYSTEM-level privileges, granting attackers elevated access and control.
- **Stealth and Evasion**: Attackers utilize legitimate Windows services to hide malicious activities, making detection challenging without proactive monitoring.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Attackers may leverage compromised port monitors to silently exfiltrate sensitive data or credentials from victim systems.
- **System Stability and Integrity**: Malicious DLLs may cause system instability, crashes, or performance degradation, affecting business operations and continuity.

Early detection minimizes the attacker's dwell time, reduces potential damage, and prevents further lateral movement or compromise within the network.

## Examples

Real-world examples and attack scenarios involving malicious port monitors include:

- **DePriMon Malware**:

  - Discovered by ESET researchers, DePriMon malware utilized port monitors to achieve persistence and stealth.
  - Attackers registered malicious DLLs as port monitors, enabling automatic execution by the spooler service.
  - Impact: Allowed attackers persistent, stealthy access to victim systems, enabling espionage and data exfiltration.

- **Stuxnet Worm**:

  - Stuxnet, a sophisticated state-sponsored worm, leveraged malicious DLLs registered as port monitors for persistence and privilege escalation.
  - Attackers exploited spooler service loading behavior to execute malicious payloads covertly.
  - Impact: Sabotaged Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, demonstrating critical infrastructure risks and potential physical damage.

- **APT Activity and Espionage Campaigns**:
  - Multiple advanced persistent threat groups have been observed using port monitors to maintain long-term stealthy presence on compromised networks.
  - Attackers typically register DLLs with legitimate-sounding names to evade detection.
  - Impact: Persistent espionage, data theft, and lateral movement across targeted enterprise environments.

These examples highlight the versatility and danger of port monitor abuse, emphasizing the importance of proactive detection and mitigation strategies.

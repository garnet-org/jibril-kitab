# Data from Information Repositories

## Information

* Name: Data from Information Repositories
* ID: T1213
* Tactics: [TA0009](../)
* Sub-Technique: [T1213.002](t1213.002.md), [T1213.001](t1213.001.md), [T1213.004](t1213.004.md), [T1213.003](t1213.003.md), T1213.005

## Introduction

Data from Information Repositories (MITRE ATT\&CK ID: T1213) refers to adversaries leveraging publicly available or internally accessible data repositories to gather valuable information for planning and executing cyberattacks. These repositories can include code repositories, cloud storage, collaboration platforms, internal documentation portals, and knowledge management systems. Attackers utilize such data to understand organizational structure, technical infrastructure, credentials, sensitive business information, and security procedures, enabling them to refine their attack strategies and increase their chances of success.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers commonly exploit information repositories through various execution methods and mechanisms:

* **Public Code Repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)**:
  * Attackers search for inadvertently committed sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, certificates, and configuration files.
  * Automated tools like GitRob, GitLeaks, TruffleHog, and Git-secrets can be used to identify sensitive data in repositories.
* **Internal Documentation and Collaboration Platforms (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint, internal Wikis)**:
  * Adversaries attempt to gain unauthorized access or leverage compromised credentials to access these platforms.
  * They search for sensitive documentation, network diagrams, credentials, internal policies, and security procedures.
* **Cloud Storage Repositories (e.g., AWS S3 buckets, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)**:
  * Attackers scan for publicly accessible or misconfigured cloud storage buckets that contain sensitive data.
  * Tools like AWSBucketDump, CloudBrute, and CloudScraper automate the discovery of exposed storage resources.
* **File Shares and FTP Servers**:
  * Attackers enumerate internal network file shares and FTP servers for sensitive documents, credentials, or intellectual property.
  * Techniques include SMB enumeration, FTP anonymous login checks, and brute-forcing weakly protected shares.
* **Paste Sites and Forums (e.g., Pastebin, GitHub Gists, forums, dark web marketplaces)**:
  * Attackers monitor these platforms to discover leaked credentials, internal information, or sensitive data inadvertently posted by employees or third parties.
* **Search Engine Dorks**:
  * Attackers utilize specialized search queries ("Google dorks") to identify exposed documents, configuration files, and sensitive information indexed by search engines.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This technique appears throughout multiple stages of the cyberattack lifecycle, including:

* **Reconnaissance Stage**:
  * Attackers gather initial intelligence about the target organization to plan further attacks.
  * They identify network layouts, employee information, system configurations, and security controls.
* **Resource Development Stage**:
  * Adversaries leverage gathered information to craft targeted phishing emails, social engineering attacks, or malware payloads tailored specifically to the victim organization.
* **Initial Access Stage**:
  * Attackers exploit leaked credentials or sensitive information found in repositories to gain initial footholds in the network.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement Stages**:
  * Attackers use information from repositories to identify privileged accounts, internal systems, or administrative credentials, facilitating lateral movement and privilege escalation.
* **Impact and Exfiltration Stages**:
  * Adversaries leverage sensitive business information and intellectual property obtained from repositories to cause business disruption, blackmail, or perform data exfiltration.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of adversaries exploiting information repositories involves multiple layers and methods:

* **Monitoring and Auditing Public Repositories**:
  * Regular scans using tools such as Git-secrets, TruffleHog, GitLeaks, or GitGuardian to identify sensitive information leaks.
  * Establishing alerts for newly created repositories or suspicious commits containing sensitive information.
* **Cloud Storage Monitoring and Configuration Audits**:
  * Regularly auditing cloud storage bucket permissions and configurations using tools like AWS Config, Azure Security Center, or Google Cloud Security Command Center.
  * Monitoring access logs for unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
* **Internal Documentation Platform Monitoring**:
  * Implementing access control audits and logging user activity on internal collaboration platforms (Confluence, SharePoint).
  * Using User Behavior Analytics (UBA) tools to detect anomalous access patterns or data downloads.
* **Network File Share and FTP Server Monitoring**:
  * Monitoring SMB and FTP access logs for anomalous activity, such as unauthorized enumeration attempts or brute-force login attempts.
  * Deploying intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
* **Paste Site and Dark Web Monitoring**:
  * Using threat intelligence services and automated monitoring tools (e.g., Recorded Future, Digital Shadows, Pastebin scrapers) to identify leaked credentials or sensitive information related to the organization.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* Unusual or unauthorized access attempts to internal documentation platforms.
* Public exposure of sensitive files or credentials on code repositories or paste sites.
* Sudden spikes in access or downloads from collaboration platforms or file shares.
* Detection of sensitive information indexed by search engines.
* Logs indicating enumeration or scanning attempts against cloud storage buckets.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of adversaries exploiting information repositories is critical due to the significant impacts on organizations, including:

* **Credential Exposure**:
  * Leaked credentials can lead to unauthorized access, lateral movement, and privilege escalation within the organization's infrastructure.
* **Data Breaches and Intellectual Property Theft**:
  * Sensitive business information, intellectual property, trade secrets, or customer data exposed through repositories can result in financial loss, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.
* **Increased Risk of Targeted Attacks**:
  * Information gathered from repositories enables attackers to craft highly targeted phishing campaigns, social engineering attacks, or malware payloads, increasing the likelihood of successful compromise.
* **Operational Disruption**:
  * Attackers can leverage exposed internal documentation to disrupt business operations, sabotage critical systems, or launch ransomware attacks.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Issues**:
  * Exposure of sensitive data through information repositories can result in violations of compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), leading to regulatory fines and legal consequences.

Early detection enables organizations to respond quickly, remediate vulnerabilities, and mitigate potential impacts, thereby reducing overall risk and enhancing cybersecurity posture.

## Examples

Real-world examples highlighting the exploitation of information repositories include:

* **Uber Data Breach (2016)**:
  * Attackers discovered AWS credentials inadvertently committed to GitHub repositories by Uber engineers.
  * These credentials allowed attackers to access Uber's AWS infrastructure, resulting in the theft of personal data from millions of users and drivers.
  * Impact: Significant reputational damage, regulatory fines, and costly remediation efforts.
* **Capital One Data Breach (2019)**:
  * Misconfigured AWS S3 buckets and EC2 instances exposed sensitive customer data.
  * Attacker exploited these misconfigurations to access personal information of approximately 100 million customers.
  * Impact: Extensive data breach, legal and regulatory penalties, and significant financial and reputational damage.
* **Slack Tokens Exposure (Multiple Incidents)**:
  * Many organizations inadvertently committed Slack API tokens to public GitHub repositories.
  * Attackers leveraged these tokens to gain unauthorized access to internal Slack workspaces, potentially exposing internal communications and sensitive data.
  * Impact: Potential data leakage, unauthorized access to internal communications, and increased risk of targeted attacks.
* **Nissan North America Source Code Exposure (2021)**:
  * Misconfigured Git server exposed Nissan's proprietary source code and internal tools publicly.
  * Attackers could potentially leverage exposed intellectual property and internal information for targeted attacks or competitive advantage.
  * Impact: Intellectual property exposure, competitive disadvantage, and heightened cybersecurity risk.
* **Pastebin Credential Dumps (Ongoing)**:
  * Attackers frequently leak stolen credentials and sensitive information on paste sites, forums, or dark web marketplaces.
  * Organizations unaware of these leaks remain vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks, unauthorized access, and targeted phishing campaigns.
  * Impact: Persistent risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and targeted attacks.

These examples emphasize the importance of securing information repositories, continuous monitoring, and prompt response to detected exposures.

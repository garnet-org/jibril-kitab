# Sharepoint

## Information

* Name: Sharepoint
* ID: T1213.002
* Tactics: [TA0009](../)
* Technique: [T1213](./)

## Introduction

The MITRE ATT\&CK sub-technique T1213.002, "SharePoint," is categorized under the broader technique "Data from Information Repositories." It specifically addresses adversaries leveraging SharePoint repositories to access sensitive organizational data. SharePoint, a widely used collaboration and document management platform, often contains critical business information, making it a prime target for attackers seeking valuable intelligence or proprietary data.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries exploiting SharePoint (T1213.002) typically focus on unauthorized access to sensitive documents and data stored within SharePoint sites. SharePoint platforms, whether hosted on-premises or in cloud environments (such as SharePoint Online within Microsoft 365), offer extensive document libraries, file-sharing capabilities, and collaboration tools. These features, while beneficial for productivity, also present attractive targets for threat actors.

Technical mechanisms and execution methods include:

* **Credential Theft and Abuse:** Attackers often obtain valid user credentials through phishing, credential dumping, or brute-force attacks, subsequently using these credentials to access SharePoint repositories.
* **API Misuse:** Adversaries may leverage SharePoint REST APIs or Microsoft Graph APIs to automate data retrieval, bypassing traditional user interfaces and potentially evading detection.
* **Exploiting Misconfigured Permissions:** Improperly configured permissions within SharePoint sites can grant unauthorized users access to sensitive documents. Attackers frequently scan for publicly exposed or overly permissive SharePoint sites.
* **Malicious Applications and OAuth Abuse:** Attackers may register malicious applications with OAuth permissions to access SharePoint resources, allowing them to bypass standard authentication controls.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Once accessed, attackers typically download, copy, or sync files and folders from SharePoint sites to external locations or cloud storage services under their control.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique appears in various attack scenarios and stages, particularly:

* **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:** Attackers may initially gain access to SharePoint sites to identify sensitive data that can inform further attack stages.
* **Collection and Exfiltration Stages:** Attackers often use SharePoint access to collect sensitive documents, intellectual property, or confidential communications for later exfiltration.
* **Espionage and Data Theft Campaigns:** Nation-state actors frequently target SharePoint repositories to gather intelligence on business operations, government activities, or proprietary research.
* **Insider Threat Scenarios:** Malicious insiders or compromised employees may leverage their legitimate access to SharePoint to steal data or facilitate unauthorized data sharing.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of unauthorized SharePoint access typically involves a combination of monitoring strategies, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Audit Logs and Event Monitoring:**
  * Regularly review SharePoint audit logs for unusual access patterns, such as multiple failed authentication attempts, abnormal download volumes, or access during irregular hours.
  * Monitor Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Logs and Azure Active Directory (AAD) sign-in logs for suspicious activities related to SharePoint access.
* **Behavioral Analytics:**
  * Implement User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) solutions to identify anomalous user behaviors, such as sudden spikes in data downloads or access to previously untouched SharePoint sites.
* **API Usage Monitoring:**
  * Monitor SharePoint REST API and Microsoft Graph API access logs for suspicious automated requests or unusual application identities.
* **Permission Auditing:**
  * Regularly audit SharePoint permissions and configurations to detect overly permissive access or unauthorized sharing of sensitive documents.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * Deploy EDR solutions to detect suspicious processes or scripts accessing SharePoint data via endpoints.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual IP addresses or geographic locations accessing SharePoint resources.
  * Anomalous OAuth application registrations and permissions requesting SharePoint access.
  * Sudden large-scale downloads or file synchronization from SharePoint sites.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Timely detection of unauthorized SharePoint access is critical due to the significant impacts it can have on organizations, including:

* **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to SharePoint repositories can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive or confidential information, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII).
* **Financial and Reputational Damage:** Exposure or theft of sensitive information can result in significant financial losses, regulatory fines, and severe damage to an organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Operational Disruption:** Attackers who modify or delete SharePoint data can disrupt critical business operations, collaboration, and productivity.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Risks:** Organizations handling regulated data (such as healthcare, financial, or government data) are at risk of compliance violations and associated penalties if SharePoint data is compromised.
* **Further Exploitation:** Initial unauthorized access to SharePoint can provide attackers with information useful for conducting follow-on attacks, such as targeted phishing campaigns, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.

## Examples

Real-world incidents involving SharePoint exploitation demonstrate the effectiveness and impact of this sub-technique:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) SolarWinds Incident:**
  * Attackers leveraged compromised credentials and OAuth application abuse to access Microsoft 365 environments, including SharePoint Online, to extract sensitive email communications and documents.
  * Impact included widespread espionage activity, significant data exfiltration, and long-term persistence within victim environments.
* **Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10):**
  * Nation-state threat actors compromised managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers' SharePoint repositories, accessing sensitive intellectual property and confidential business data.
  * Attackers utilized stolen credentials and API access to automate data collection and exfiltration processes.
* **Insider Threat Cases:**
  * Numerous incidents documented where disgruntled or compromised employees used legitimate SharePoint access to exfiltrate proprietary information, trade secrets, or customer data.
  * Impacts included loss of competitive advantage, financial damage, and legal repercussions.
* **Ransomware and Extortion Groups:**
  * Some ransomware groups have used compromised SharePoint access to exfiltrate sensitive documents, subsequently threatening public exposure and demanding ransom payments.
  * Impacts included financial losses, operational disruption, and reputational harm.

These examples illustrate the diverse methods attackers employ to exploit SharePoint repositories, emphasizing the importance of robust monitoring, detection, and response strategies to mitigate risks associated with this sub-technique.

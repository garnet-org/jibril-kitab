# Code Repositories

## Information

* Name: Code Repositories
* ID: T1213.003
* Tactics: [TA0009](../)
* Technique: [T1213](./)

## Introduction

The MITRE ATT\&CK sub-technique "Code Repositories" (T1213.003) falls under the broader technique "Data from Information Repositories." This sub-technique specifically addresses adversaries' exploitation of source code repositories to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Attackers target repositories hosted internally or externally to obtain intellectual property, credentials, proprietary algorithms, or configuration data. Leveraging these repositories allows adversaries to perform reconnaissance, escalate privileges, or facilitate further exploitation within victim environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries commonly exploit code repositories through various methods and mechanisms, including:

* **Publicly Accessible Repositories**:
  * Attackers search public repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for accidentally exposed sensitive data, credentials, or API keys.
  * Using automated scanning tools and scripts, adversaries rapidly identify and collect leaked information.
* **Internal Repositories**:
  * Attackers who have gained initial access to internal networks may target internal version control systems (e.g., internal GitLab or Bitbucket servers).
  * Exploiting misconfigured access controls, insecure authentication mechanisms, or vulnerabilities in repository software itself.
* **Credential Harvesting**:
  * Harvesting credentials stored in plaintext within codebases, configuration files, or commit histories.
  * Utilizing discovered credentials to pivot within networks or access additional resources.
* **Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering**:
  * Reviewing source code to identify vulnerabilities, architectural weaknesses, or sensitive business logic.
  * Collecting information that facilitates lateral movement, privilege escalation, or targeted attacks.
* **Exploitation of Repository Vulnerabilities**:
  * Targeting known vulnerabilities in repository-management software (e.g., CVEs in GitLab, Jenkins, Bitbucket).
  * Exploiting misconfigurations such as anonymous read access, weak authentication, or improper permissions.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ this sub-technique during multiple phases of attack operations, including:

* **Initial Reconnaissance**:
  * Early stages of cyber operations to gather sensitive information from publicly available code repositories.
  * Identifying credentials, API keys, or sensitive configurations inadvertently exposed in public repositories.
* **Initial Access and Credential Access**:
  * After initial compromise, adversaries access internal repositories to locate credentials or sensitive information for lateral movement.
  * Harvesting credentials from repositories to escalate privileges or access additional resources.
* **Collection and Exfiltration**:
  * Gathering proprietary source code, intellectual property, or confidential business logic for exfiltration.
  * Exfiltrating sensitive code repositories to competitor organizations or for resale on dark web marketplaces.
* **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**:
  * Using credentials or sensitive information found in repositories to maintain persistent access or escalate privileges within compromised networks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of adversaries leveraging code repositories includes a combination of monitoring, auditing, and specialized tooling:

* **Repository Monitoring and Auditing**:
  * Regularly auditing repository access logs for unusual or unauthorized access attempts.
  * Monitoring for high-volume cloning, downloading, or unusual activity patterns.
* **Automated Scanning Tools**:
  * Deploying tools that scan repositories for exposed credentials, secrets, or sensitive data (e.g., TruffleHog, Git-secrets, GitGuardian).
  * Integrating continuous scanning into CI/CD pipelines to detect sensitive data exposure proactively.
* **Log Analysis and Alerting**:
  * Centralized logging and SIEM solutions to detect suspicious repository access behaviors or unauthorized cloning.
  * Alerting on anomalous user activity, such as access from unfamiliar IP addresses, unusual times, or unexpected user accounts.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unusual repository cloning or download events from external IP addresses.
  * Access logs showing unauthorized or unexpected users accessing repositories.
  * Detection of sensitive data leakage (credentials, API keys, configuration files) in public repositories.
  * Presence of known scanning tools or scripts on compromised systems (e.g., Gitrob, GitLeaks).

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of adversaries exploiting code repositories is crucial due to significant potential impacts, including:

* **Loss of Intellectual Property (IP)**:
  * Theft of proprietary source code or sensitive business logic can severely impact competitive advantage and business reputation.
* **Credential Exposure and Compromise**:
  * Exposed credentials can lead to unauthorized access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistent threats within enterprise networks.
* **Financial and Operational Impact**:
  * Breaches involving sensitive code repositories can result in costly incident response, remediation efforts, regulatory penalties, and loss of customer trust.
* **Facilitation of Further Attacks**:
  * Attackers leveraging sensitive information found in repositories can escalate attacks, conduct targeted phishing, ransomware deployment, or supply-chain attacks.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Risks**:
  * Exposure of sensitive data in repositories may violate compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS), leading to audits, fines, or legal actions.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating adversaries exploiting code repositories include:

* **Uber Data Breach (2016)**:
  * Attackers accessed a private GitHub repository containing credentials, leading to unauthorized access to internal databases and sensitive user information.
  * Impact: Exposure of personal data for millions of users, significant reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
* **Nissan North America Source Code Leak (2021)**:
  * Misconfigured Git repository exposed proprietary source code, internal tools, and sensitive business logic.
  * Impact: Potential exposure of intellectual property, competitive harm, and increased risk of targeted cyberattacks.
* **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020)**:
  * Attackers compromised internal source code repositories to insert malicious code into legitimate software updates.
  * Impact: Massive-scale compromise of multiple government agencies and private companies, significant operational disruption, and widespread security implications.
* **AWS Credential Leakage via GitHub (Multiple Incidents)**:
  * Attackers regularly scan public GitHub repositories for inadvertently leaked AWS access keys, leading to unauthorized access and resource hijacking.
  * Impact: Financial costs from unauthorized resource usage, data breaches, and compromised cloud environments.
* **Capital One Data Breach (2019)**:
  * Misconfigured GitHub repository exposed sensitive credentials, enabling attacker to access cloud infrastructure and databases.
  * Impact: Exposure of personal data for millions of customers, substantial financial penalties, and reputational harm.

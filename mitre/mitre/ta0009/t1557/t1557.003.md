## Information

* Name: DHCP Spoofing
* ID: T1557.003
* Tactics: [TA0006](../../ta0006/), [TA0009](../)
* Technique: [T1557](./)

## Introduction

DHCP Spoofing (T1557.003) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized within "Adversary-in-the-Middle" techniques. DHCP spoofing involves an adversary deploying a rogue DHCP server or spoofing DHCP responses to redirect network traffic through attacker-controlled infrastructure. This enables attackers to intercept, monitor, manipulate, or disrupt the victim’s network communications, often leading to further compromise or data exfiltration.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol that dynamically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters to devices on a network. DHCP spoofing occurs when an adversary sets up a malicious DHCP server or sends spoofed DHCP responses to trick client devices into accepting incorrect network configurations. The attack typically unfolds as follows:

1. **Malicious DHCP Server Deployment**:
   * The attacker introduces a rogue DHCP server into the network.
   * The rogue server responds faster than the legitimate DHCP server, causing client devices to accept the attacker’s DHCP offer.
   * Clients receive malicious network configurations, such as manipulated default gateways or DNS servers.
2. **DHCP Reply Spoofing**:
   * The attacker passively monitors DHCP requests on the network.
   * Upon detecting a DHCP DISCOVER or REQUEST message, the attacker quickly sends a spoofed DHCP OFFER or ACK response.
   * The client device accepts the spoofed response due to its faster arrival, resulting in compromised network settings.

Technical mechanisms and tools commonly associated with DHCP spoofing include:

* Use of network penetration testing tools such as Yersinia, Ettercap, or DHCPig to automate DHCP spoofing attacks.
* Manipulation of network parameters, including DNS addresses, default gateways, subnet masks, and IP address ranges.
* Exploitation of network devices with insufficient security configurations, such as unmanaged switches or lack of DHCP snooping features.

Real-world procedures often involve attackers leveraging DHCP spoofing to execute Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, intercept sensitive communications, redirect victims to phishing sites, or facilitate lateral movement within compromised networks.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

DHCP spoofing is commonly employed in various attack scenarios and stages:

* **Initial Access and Reconnaissance**:
  * Attackers deploy DHCP spoofing to intercept network traffic, gather sensitive information, and map network topology.
  * Facilitates passive reconnaissance, allowing attackers to identify potential targets, vulnerabilities, or valuable assets.
* **Credential Harvesting and Data Theft**:
  * Spoofed DHCP responses redirect traffic through attacker-controlled infrastructure, enabling interception and capture of credentials, session tokens, or sensitive data.
  * Attackers leverage captured credentials to escalate privileges, compromise additional systems, or exfiltrate sensitive information.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**:
  * DHCP spoofing is frequently combined with MitM techniques to intercept, modify, or relay network communications unnoticed.
  * Attackers manipulate DNS settings to redirect users to malicious websites or phishing pages.
* **Network Disruption and Denial-of-Service (DoS)**:
  * Attackers intentionally distribute incorrect network parameters, causing network outages, connectivity issues, or service disruptions, often as part of broader denial-of-service attacks.
* **Lateral Movement and Persistence**:
  * Once attackers gain initial footholds, DHCP spoofing facilitates lateral movement by intercepting credentials or sensitive network communications.
  * Attackers maintain persistence by continuously intercepting traffic and adjusting network configurations to evade detection.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of DHCP spoofing attacks involves various methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **DHCP Snooping Implementation**:
  * Network switches configured with DHCP snooping can detect and block unauthorized DHCP responses.
  * DHCP snooping validates DHCP messages and prevents rogue DHCP servers from assigning IP addresses.
* **Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis**:
  * Continuous monitoring of network traffic using intrusion detection systems (IDS) or network security monitoring (NSM) tools.
  * Detection of multiple DHCP responses from different MAC addresses or unexpected DHCP servers.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Solutions**:
  * Centralized log aggregation and analysis to detect abnormal DHCP server activity or unexpected network configuration changes.
  * Alerts triggered by unusual DHCP server activity or suspicious DHCP lease assignments.
* **Endpoint and Host-Based Detection**:
  * Endpoint security solutions detecting unexpected network configuration changes, such as DNS or default gateway modifications.
  * Host-based firewall alerts indicating suspicious DHCP traffic or unexpected DHCP server addresses.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unexpected DHCP server IP addresses or MAC addresses appearing in network logs.
  * Presence of unauthorized DHCP servers detected through network scans or asset management tools.
  * Sudden changes in DNS servers or default gateways without administrative approval.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of DHCP spoofing attacks is critical due to their potential impact on system and network security:

* **Data Interception and Theft**:
  * Attackers intercept sensitive data, including credentials, financial information, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII).
  * Early detection prevents significant data breaches and mitigates data loss.
* **Credential Compromise and Privilege Escalation**:
  * DHCP spoofing enables attackers to capture credentials, facilitating unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.
  * Detection prevents attackers from gaining persistent footholds and limits damage scope.
* **Network Disruption and Downtime**:
  * Malicious DHCP configurations lead to network outages, degraded performance, or denial-of-service conditions.
  * Early detection minimizes operational disruptions, maintaining business continuity and productivity.
* **Reputation and Compliance Risk**:
  * Undetected DHCP spoofing incidents may lead to regulatory non-compliance, data breaches, and reputational damage.
  * Timely detection demonstrates proactive security posture, compliance adherence, and reduces legal or regulatory risks.
* **Facilitating Further Attacks**:
  * DHCP spoofing serves as a gateway to more severe attacks, such as MitM, lateral movement, or ransomware deployment.
  * Early detection disrupts attacker kill-chains, preventing escalation and minimizing overall impact.

## Examples

Real-world examples showcasing DHCP spoofing attacks, tools used, and associated impacts include:

* **Yersinia Tool Usage**:
  * Attackers utilize the Yersinia penetration testing framework to launch DHCP spoofing attacks, intercept network traffic, and redirect users to malicious servers.
  * Impact includes credential theft, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.
* **Ettercap for MitM Attacks**:
  * Ettercap, a popular network interception tool, is frequently leveraged alongside DHCP spoofing to perform MitM attacks on local networks.
  * Attackers capture sensitive data, manipulate network communications, and redirect users to phishing sites.
* **Corporate Network Intrusion**:
  * In 2019, attackers compromised a corporate network by deploying a rogue DHCP server, redirecting employee traffic through attacker-controlled infrastructure.
  * Resulted in significant credential compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, and data exfiltration incidents.
* **University Campus Attack Scenario**:
  * Attackers targeted a university campus network using DHCP spoofing, redirecting student and faculty network traffic.
  * Attackers captured login credentials, gained unauthorized access to academic resources, and disrupted network services, impacting productivity and causing significant remediation efforts.
* **Financial Sector Incident**:
  * Financial institutions have experienced DHCP spoofing attacks, redirecting internal traffic to malicious DNS servers.
  * Attackers successfully harvested credentials, accessed sensitive financial data, and initiated fraudulent transactions, resulting in substantial financial losses and compliance violations.

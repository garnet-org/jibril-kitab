# Network Device Configuration Dump

## Information

* Name: Network Device Configuration Dump
* ID: T1602.002
* Tactics: [TA0009](../)
* Technique: [T1602](./)

## Introduction

Network Device Configuration Dump (T1602.002) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework's "Data from Configuration Repository" (T1602). This sub-technique involves adversaries extracting configuration files or settings from network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and other infrastructure components. By obtaining these configurations, attackers can gain valuable information including network topology, credentials, access control policies, encryption keys, and other sensitive parameters. This information can subsequently facilitate further exploitation, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or disruption of network operations.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries typically execute this technique by accessing network devices through various methods, including:

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in network device firmware or software to gain unauthorized access.
* Using stolen or default credentials to log in directly to the device via SSH, Telnet, HTTP/HTTPS, or SNMP.
* Leveraging misconfigured network management protocols like SNMP to extract configurations remotely.
* Employing automated scripts or tools that specifically target configuration extraction from network infrastructure.

Technical mechanisms and execution methods include:

* **Command-line Interface (CLI) Access**: Attackers may issue commands such as `show running-config`, `show startup-config`, or equivalent device-specific commands to retrieve configuration data.
* **SNMP Queries**: Attackers may use SNMP GET requests targeting OIDs (Object Identifiers) that store device configurations or sensitive information.
* **File Transfer Protocols**: Attackers may transfer configuration files using TFTP, FTP, SCP, or SFTP after gaining administrative access.
* **Web-based Management Interfaces**: Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities or weak authentication in web interfaces to download configuration backups directly.

Real-world procedures often include:

* Automated scripts or malware that scan networks for devices with default or weak credentials.
* Exploitation frameworks such as Metasploit modules specifically designed to extract configurations from network devices.
* Leveraging publicly available exploits targeting known vulnerabilities in widely used network equipment.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers employ the Network Device Configuration Dump technique during multiple stages and scenarios, including:

* **Initial Reconnaissance**: To map out internal network topology, identify critical assets, and discover potential vulnerabilities.
* **Privilege Escalation and Credential Harvesting**: To extract administrative credentials or authentication keys stored in configurations, enabling further lateral movement.
* **Persistence and Backdoor Installation**: To modify configurations and maintain persistent access to network infrastructure.
* **Pre-attack Planning for Network Disruption or Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: To identify critical network devices and their configurations, facilitating targeted attacks that disrupt network operations.
* **Espionage and Data Theft Campaigns**: To quietly gather sensitive network information for long-term espionage purposes.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of configuration extraction from network devices typically involves:

* **Monitoring Device Logs**: Regularly reviewing logs for suspicious administrative sessions, unusual CLI commands (e.g., `show running-config`), or unauthorized SNMP access.
* **Network Traffic Analysis**: Using network monitoring tools and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect abnormal traffic patterns, such as unusual SNMP queries or file transfers (TFTP, FTP, SCP).
* **Configuration Audits and Integrity Checks**: Periodically auditing device configurations and comparing them against known secure baselines to identify unauthorized changes or access.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and SIEM Solutions**: Leveraging security information and event management systems or EDR tools to correlate anomalies across devices and network segments.
* **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unusual administrative sessions originating from unknown or suspicious IP addresses.
  * SNMP queries from unauthorized hosts or unusual queries targeting sensitive OIDs.
  * Unexpected configuration changes or additions of unauthorized user accounts and credentials.
  * Anomalous file transfers involving configuration backups or archives.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting network device configuration dumps is critically important due to the following potential impacts and risks:

* **Exposure of Sensitive Information**: Configurations often contain sensitive details such as passwords, encryption keys, and network topologies, enabling attackers to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
* **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation**: Attackers may leverage extracted credentials or keys to gain deeper access into network segments or critical systems.
* **Network Disruption and Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Adversaries can exploit configuration data to disrupt or degrade network services intentionally.
* **Persistence and Long-term Compromise**: Attackers may modify device configurations to create persistent backdoors and maintain prolonged unauthorized access.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Risks**: Exposure or compromise of network configurations can lead to compliance violations, regulatory fines, and significant reputational damage for organizations.

Early detection is essential to mitigate these risks, limit the scope of compromise, and prevent further exploitation or damage to organizational assets.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating Network Device Configuration Dump include:

* **APT41 (Winnti Group)**:
  * Attack Scenario: Targeted telecommunications and technology companies to extract router and firewall configurations.
  * Tools Used: Custom malware, scripts, and exploits specifically tailored to Cisco and Juniper devices.
  * Impact: Enabled lateral movement, persistent access, and theft of sensitive intellectual property.
* **Dragonfly 2.0 Campaign**:
  * Attack Scenario: Targeted energy sector organizations by compromising network infrastructure devices to extract configuration data.
  * Tools Used: Credential harvesting malware, SNMP enumeration tools, and direct CLI access via compromised administrator credentials.
  * Impact: Allowed detailed reconnaissance of network infrastructure, facilitating subsequent targeted attacks against critical infrastructure.
* **Cisco Smart Install Exploitation Campaigns**:
  * Attack Scenario: Exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco Smart Install protocol to remotely dump configuration files from exposed switches.
  * Tools Used: Open-source scripts and publicly available exploits targeting Cisco devices.
  * Impact: Large-scale unauthorized access to network device configurations, exposing sensitive credentials and network topology information.
* **Operation ShadowHammer (ASUS Supply Chain Attack)**:
  * Attack Scenario: Compromised network devices within supply chain networks, extracting configurations to identify critical assets and facilitate lateral movement.
  * Tools Used: Malware embedded in compromised firmware updates, credential-stealing tools.
  * Impact: Enabled attackers to conduct targeted espionage, persistence, and lateral movement within victim networks.

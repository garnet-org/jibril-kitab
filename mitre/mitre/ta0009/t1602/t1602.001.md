# SNMP (MIB Dump)

## Information

* Name: SNMP (MIB Dump)
* ID: T1602.001
* Tactics: [TA0009](../)
* Technique: [T1602](./)

## Introduction

SNMP MIB Dump (T1602.001) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, falling within the broader category of Data from Configuration Repository (T1602). Attackers employing this method target Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Bases (MIBs) to collect detailed configuration information and operational data from network devices. SNMP MIBs store structured device-related data, including system configurations, network topology, device performance metrics, and service statuses. Attackers leverage unauthorized access or weakly secured SNMP implementations to extract valuable intelligence from these repositories.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is commonly used for network device management and monitoring. MIBs (Management Information Bases) are hierarchical databases containing structured data about network devices, applications, and services. Attackers exploit SNMP MIB dumps through the following mechanisms and methods:

* **SNMP Queries**:
  * Attackers perform SNMP GET or WALK requests to enumerate device configurations, system descriptions, network interfaces, routing tables, and service-related information.
  * Tools such as `snmpwalk`, `snmpcheck`, or custom scripts are typically used to automate enumeration.
* **Weak or Default SNMP Community Strings**:
  * Attackers exploit common misconfigurations by guessing or brute-forcing default or weak SNMP community strings (e.g., "public," "private," "community").
  * Once authenticated, attackers retrieve extensive device information without requiring elevated privileges.
* **SNMPv3 Authentication Bypass**:
  * SNMP version 3 provides enhanced security features, but misconfigurations or weak authentication credentials can still be exploited.
  * Attackers may attempt credential stuffing or brute-force attacks against SNMPv3 implementations.
* **Leveraging SNMP Information for Further Attacks**:
  * SNMP MIB dumps can provide attackers with sensitive infrastructure details, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, routing information, VLAN configurations, and security settings.
  * This information can be leveraged for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or further reconnaissance.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically utilize SNMP MIB dumps in various attack stages and scenarios, including:

* **Initial Reconnaissance Phase**:
  * Gathering detailed network topology, device types, software versions, and configurations.
  * Identifying vulnerable devices or potential pivot points within the targeted environment.
* **Internal Network Enumeration**:
  * After establishing initial footholds, attackers perform SNMP MIB dumps to map internal network infrastructure and identify critical assets and sensitive systems.
* **Persistence and Lateral Movement**:
  * Attackers use SNMP data to identify additional targets, vulnerable hosts, or misconfigured devices to expand their foothold within the internal network.
* **Pre-Exploitation Intelligence Gathering**:
  * Attackers gather detailed configuration data to craft targeted exploits or identify weak points in network security controls.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Campaigns**:
  * Nation-state actors or sophisticated adversaries frequently exploit SNMP MIB dumps for prolonged reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and infrastructure mapping in targeted intrusions.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of SNMP MIB dump activities involves monitoring, alerting, and analyzing network traffic and device logs. Common detection methods include:

* **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
  * Monitor SNMP traffic (UDP port 161) for unusual or excessive queries from unknown or suspicious IP addresses.
  * Analyze anomalies in SNMP request frequency, volume, or unusual OID (Object Identifier) queries.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**:
  * Deploy network IDS/IPS signatures to detect known malicious SNMP enumeration scripts or tools (e.g., `snmpwalk`, `snmpcheck`).
  * Configure alerts for SNMP requests from unauthorized or unknown hosts.
* **SIEM Log Analysis and Correlation**:
  * Aggregate SNMP access logs and correlate them with other security events to identify suspicious patterns or activities.
  * Identify attempts to authenticate using default or weak SNMP community strings through log analysis.
* **Endpoint and Device Logging**:
  * Enable detailed logging and auditing on network devices to capture SNMP access attempts, authentication attempts, and successful enumeration activities.
  * Regularly review SNMP authentication logs for signs of unauthorized access attempts or enumeration activities.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* Unusual SNMP queries originating from unknown or external IP addresses.
* Excessive or repetitive SNMP GET/WALK requests against multiple devices.
* SNMP queries using default or common community strings (e.g., "public", "private").
* Alerts triggered by IDS/IPS signatures for known SNMP enumeration tools.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of SNMP MIB dumps is crucial due to the significant impacts on organizational security posture and operational integrity. Possible impacts include:

* **Sensitive Information Disclosure**:
  * Attackers can obtain detailed device configurations, network topology, routing information, and security settings, enabling targeted exploitation and privilege escalation.
* **Network Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement**:
  * Detailed network data can facilitate lateral movement, allowing attackers to pivot to sensitive or critical systems within an environment.
* **Operational Disruption and Denial of Service**:
  * Attackers may leverage SNMP-derived information to identify critical devices and services, facilitating targeted denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or operational disruptions.
* **Enhanced Attack Effectiveness**:
  * Accurate intelligence gathered from SNMP MIB dumps allows attackers to craft precise exploits and evade detection more effectively.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Risks**:
  * Unauthorized access to sensitive network information can lead to compliance violations, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.

Thus, early detection and response to SNMP MIB dump activities significantly reduce the overall risk exposure and potential damage to the organization.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating SNMP MIB dump exploitation include:

* **APT28 (Fancy Bear)**:
  * APT28, a Russian-affiliated threat actor, has historically leveraged SNMP enumeration techniques during reconnaissance phases to map targeted organizations' network infrastructure. This intelligence gathering enabled subsequent targeted intrusions and lateral movement.
* **Cisco SNMP Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2017-6736)**:
  * Attackers exploited a vulnerability in SNMP implementation on Cisco IOS and IOS XE devices, allowing unauthorized attackers to retrieve sensitive configuration information via SNMP queries. Attackers used this information to facilitate subsequent exploitation attempts.
* **Mirai Botnet**:
  * The Mirai IoT botnet utilized default SNMP community strings to enumerate network devices and IoT equipment, identifying vulnerable targets to exploit and recruit into the botnet infrastructure.
* **SNMP Reconnaissance Tools â€“ snmpwalk/snmpcheck**:
  * Attackers frequently use publicly available tools such as `snmpwalk` and `snmpcheck` to automate SNMP enumeration and MIB dumps. These tools are commonly observed in penetration testing engagements and malicious reconnaissance activities.

In each example, attackers leveraged SNMP MIB dumps to gather sensitive network and device information, significantly enhancing their ability to conduct targeted attacks, lateral movement, and exploitation within compromised environments.

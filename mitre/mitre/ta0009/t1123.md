# Audio Capture

## Information

* Name: Audio Capture
* ID: T1123
* Tactics: [TA0009](./)

## Introduction

Audio Capture (Technique ID: T1123) is an adversary tactic outlined in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the category of Collection. It involves adversaries capturing audio data from compromised systems, typically through microphones or other audio input devices. Attackers utilize this technique primarily to gather sensitive information, conduct espionage, or gain strategic advantages through surveillance. Capturing audio can reveal confidential conversations, sensitive business information, or personal details that can be exploited further by adversaries.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Audio Capture involves adversaries leveraging built-in or external microphones on compromised endpoints to record audio data. Attackers typically execute this technique through various methods:

* **Malware and RATs (Remote Access Trojans):**
  * Malware or RATs installed on victim systems commonly contain modules capable of audio recording.
  * These tools often record audio continuously or at scheduled intervals, transmitting collected data back to attackers via command-and-control (C2) channels.
* **Built-in OS Utilities and Tools:**
  * Attackers may use native OS utilities or scripting languages (e.g., PowerShell, Python scripts) to initiate audio recording without deploying additional malware.
  * On Windows systems, attackers might leverage APIs such as Windows Multimedia API or DirectSound.
  * On Linux or macOS, adversaries might use tools like `arecord`, `sox`, or built-in audio APIs to capture audio.
* **Browser-based Exploits:**
  * Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities or permissions granted to web browsers to secretly initiate audio recording through JavaScript or WebRTC APIs.
* **Mobile Device Exploitation:**
  * Mobile malware frequently includes capabilities to activate microphones and record audio without user awareness, leveraging Android or iOS APIs.

Mechanisms for audio capture typically involve:

* Accessing microphone hardware through software APIs.
* Encoding and compressing audio data for efficient exfiltration.
* Encrypting or obfuscating captured audio data to evade detection during transfer.

Real-world procedures typically include:

* Stealthy activation of microphones without visual indicators.
* Scheduled or event-triggered audio capture to optimize data collection and reduce detection risks.
* Secure transmission of captured audio data to external servers or cloud storage controlled by attackers.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly utilize Audio Capture in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Espionage Operations:**
  * Nation-state actors frequently use audio capture to spy on political figures, diplomats, military personnel, or business executives.
  * Capturing sensitive conversations and meetings to gain strategic intelligence.
* **Corporate Espionage:**
  * Competitor or insider threats capturing confidential business discussions, trade secrets, or intellectual property.
* **Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:**
  * Early attack stages to gather intelligence on victim organizations, personnel, or infrastructure.
* **Blackmail and Extortion:**
  * Capturing sensitive or embarrassing conversations to extort victims or organizations.
* **Insider Threat Scenarios:**
  * Malicious insiders leveraging organizational access to capture audio for personal gain or sabotage.
* **Targeted Attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):**
  * APT groups employing audio capture as part of broader, long-term surveillance campaigns.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Audio Capture involves multiple methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Endpoint Monitoring and Behavioral Analysis:**
  * Monitoring suspicious processes accessing microphone devices.
  * Detecting unusual microphone activation events or prolonged audio recording sessions.
  * Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools can flag unauthorized microphone access attempts.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Analyzing outbound network traffic for unusual data transfers, such as large or regular uploads indicative of audio data exfiltration.
  * Identifying connections to suspicious C2 servers or cloud storage services.
* **System and Application Logs:**
  * Reviewing OS logs for microphone access events or unusual multimedia API calls.
  * Checking browser permission logs for unauthorized microphone activation.
* **Security Tools and Solutions:**
  * Implementing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions that detect audio file exfiltration.
  * Antivirus and anti-malware software detecting known malware or RATs with audio recording modules.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Presence of audio recording software or scripts in unusual directories.
  * Suspicious audio file formats (.wav, .mp3, .aac, .ogg) stored temporarily or persistently on endpoints.
  * Unusual microphone permission grants or browser microphone access history.
* **User Awareness and Reporting:**
  * Users reporting unexpected microphone activation indicators (such as microphone lights or notifications).

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Audio Capture is crucial due to its significant potential impacts:

* **Privacy Violations:**
  * Unauthorized recording of confidential conversations, meetings, or personal discussions severely compromises privacy.
* **Loss of Sensitive Information and Trade Secrets:**
  * Captured audio can contain proprietary business information, intellectual property, or strategic plans, leading to economic losses and competitive disadvantage.
* **Reputational Damage:**
  * Exposure of sensitive audio content can damage organizational or individual reputations, compromising trust and credibility.
* **Legal and Compliance Risks:**
  * Unauthorized audio capture may violate privacy laws, regulations (such as GDPR, HIPAA), and industry standards, resulting in legal penalties and compliance issues.
* **Blackmail and Extortion Risks:**
  * Attackers using sensitive audio recordings to extort individuals or organizations, demanding ransom or concessions.
* **Operational Security (OPSEC) Risks:**
  * Captured audio revealing operational plans, strategies, or security measures can severely compromise organizational security posture.

Early detection allows organizations to:

* Limit damage by promptly isolating affected systems.
* Initiate incident response procedures quickly.
* Mitigate potential data loss, privacy breaches, and reputational harm.
* Strengthen security controls and employee awareness to prevent future incidents.

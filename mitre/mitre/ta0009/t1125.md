# Video Capture

## Information

* Name: Video Capture
* ID: T1125
* Tactics: [TA0009](./)

## Introduction

Video Capture is categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework as a technique attackers use to record visual data from compromised systems. This technique involves capturing video feeds from webcams, security cameras, or screen-capture software to gather sensitive information, monitor user activities, or conduct espionage. Attackers commonly leverage this method to spy on targets, collect intelligence, and facilitate further attack strategies.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers typically execute Video Capture through various technical methods:

* **Webcam Hijacking:**
  * Malware or Remote Access Trojans (RATs) gain unauthorized access to built-in or external webcams.
  * Attackers remotely activate webcams without user consent, often disabling camera indicator lights to avoid suspicion.
* **Security Camera Exploitation:**
  * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in IP-based surveillance cameras or DVR systems.
  * Common vulnerabilities include default credentials, outdated firmware, and insecure network configurations.
* **Screen Capture Software:**
  * Malware may silently install or exploit legitimate screen-recording software to capture user activity.
  * Attackers may employ keyloggers or spyware that include screen-capturing functionality.
* **Remote Administration Tools (RATs):**
  * Attackers use RATs such as DarkComet, Blackshades, or njRAT, which include built-in video-capturing modules.
  * RATs enable remote viewing and recording of victim screens or webcams.

Technical mechanisms involved include:

* Direct API calls to hardware drivers or OS-level camera APIs.
* Exploitation of software vulnerabilities in video conferencing or streaming applications.
* Injection of malicious code into legitimate processes to stealthily capture video streams.

Real-world procedures commonly involve:

* Social engineering to trick users into installing malware with video capture capabilities.
* Exploiting known vulnerabilities in commonly used software (e.g., Zoom, Skype) to intercept video streams.
* Leveraging compromised IoT devices (e.g., smart cameras) to obtain unauthorized video access.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers utilize Video Capture in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Reconnaissance and Espionage:**
  * Gathering intelligence on high-value targets, such as government officials, executives, or critical infrastructure operators.
  * Monitoring user behavior, routines, and physical security measures.
* **Blackmail and Extortion:**
  * Capturing compromising videos to extort money or sensitive information from victims.
  * Threatening victims with exposure of video content to coerce compliance.
* **Credential Harvesting and Fraud:**
  * Recording screen activities to capture sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial data.
  * Observing authentication processes or multi-factor authentication (MFA) workflows.
* **Persistent Surveillance:**
  * Continuously monitoring victim environments to maintain long-term access and awareness.
  * Assessing physical security arrangements or operational schedules for future attacks.

This technique frequently appears in stages such as initial reconnaissance, persistence, data collection, and lateral movement.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Video Capture involves various methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:**
  * Monitoring unusual access to camera hardware or APIs.
  * Identifying unauthorized processes interacting with webcam drivers or screen-capture functionalities.
* **Behavioral Analysis:**
  * Detecting abnormal resource usage (e.g., CPU spikes, increased network traffic) associated with video streaming or recording.
  * Observing suspicious processes initiating webcam access without user interaction.
* **Network Traffic Monitoring:**
  * Identifying unexpected outbound network connections transferring large video files or streaming data.
  * Detecting anomalous communication patterns indicative of remote video streaming to external IP addresses.
* **Application Whitelisting and Blacklisting:**
  * Preventing unauthorized software installations, particularly known malicious screen-capturing tools or RATs.
  * Detecting execution attempts of blacklisted video-capture applications.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Presence of known RAT binaries such as DarkComet, njRAT, or Blackshades.
  * Suspicious registry keys or scheduled tasks enabling persistent video capture.
  * Unusual video files or screen captures stored in temporary directories or hidden folders.
  * Logs indicating unauthorized access attempts to camera APIs or device drivers.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Video Capture is critical due to the severe impacts it can have on systems, networks, and individuals:

* **Privacy Violations:**
  * Unauthorized video recording severely compromises user privacy and confidentiality.
  * Sensitive personal or corporate information can be exposed or misused.
* **Espionage and Intelligence Gathering:**
  * Attackers can collect critical intelligence on organizational operations, intellectual property, or strategic plans.
  * Video surveillance enables adversaries to plan further attacks more effectively.
* **Financial and Reputational Damage:**
  * Blackmail or extortion attempts can result in significant financial losses or reputational harm.
  * Exposure of sensitive video content can damage trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders.
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Compromised surveillance systems or webcams can lead to disruption in operational activities or critical infrastructure.
  * Attackers may leverage captured video information to facilitate physical intrusion or sabotage.

Early detection enables organizations to mitigate these risks promptly, preventing prolonged exposure and reducing potential damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of Video Capture techniques include:

* **Blackshades RAT Campaign:**
  * Attack Scenario: Attackers deployed Blackshades malware via phishing emails and malicious downloads.
  * Tools Used: Blackshades RAT, enabling remote webcam activation, screen recording, and file exfiltration.
  * Impact: Thousands of individuals worldwide had their webcams activated without consent, leading to privacy violations and extortion attempts.
* **Operation Ghost Click:**
  * Attack Scenario: Attackers infected millions of computers globally with malware capable of video capture and remote monitoring.
  * Tools Used: DNSChanger malware, which included capabilities to intercept and record user activities.
  * Impact: Attackers captured sensitive user information, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and significant operational disruptions.
* **Zoom Vulnerabilities Exploitation (CVE-2019-13450):**
  * Attack Scenario: Exploited vulnerabilities in Zoom video conferencing software allowed unauthorized webcam activation and recording.
  * Tools Used: Exploit scripts targeting Zoom client vulnerabilities.
  * Impact: Potential unauthorized video capture of meetings, private conversations, and confidential information, resulting in privacy breaches and corporate espionage risks.
* **Mirai Botnet IoT Camera Exploitation:**
  * Attack Scenario: Mirai malware exploited default credentials in IoT cameras and DVR devices.
  * Tools Used: Mirai malware, automated scripts scanning for default credentials.
  * Impact: Attackers gained unauthorized access to surveillance video feeds, enabling persistent monitoring and potential use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

These examples highlight the diverse methods attackers employ to capture video, underscoring the importance of robust detection, prevention, and response strategies.

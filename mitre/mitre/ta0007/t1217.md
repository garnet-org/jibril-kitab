# Browser Information Discovery

## Information

* Name: Browser Information Discovery
* ID: T1217
* Tactics: [TA0007](./)

## Introduction

Browser Bookmark Discovery is categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework as a discovery technique (T1217) used by adversaries to gather intelligence on compromised systems. Attackers leverage browser bookmarks to identify sensitive internal URLs, web applications, intranet resources, cloud services, and user-specific interests. This information can guide further exploitation, lateral movement, and targeted phishing attacks, enhancing the attacker’s understanding of the victim’s environment and potential vulnerabilities.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Browser bookmarks typically contain URLs frequently accessed or deemed important by users, often including internal or private resources. Attackers can exploit this by:

* Accessing browser-specific bookmark storage locations:
  * Chrome stores bookmarks in `Bookmarks` and `Bookmarks.bak` files located in:
    * Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks`
    * macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks`
    * Linux: `~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks`
  * Firefox bookmarks are stored within SQLite databases (`places.sqlite`) located in:
    * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile>\places.sqlite`
    * macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile>/places.sqlite`
    * Linux: `~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>/places.sqlite`
  * Edge stores bookmarks similarly to Chrome, in JSON files within:
    * Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Bookmarks`
* Extracting bookmark data using scripts or tools capable of parsing JSON or SQLite databases.
* Automating extraction via custom scripts or leveraging post-exploitation frameworks such as Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, or Empire.
* Analyzing extracted URLs for sensitive internal resources, cloud services, or administrative portals.

Attackers commonly automate this technique to quickly enumerate valuable internal resources and pivot points within the compromised environment.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ Browser Bookmark Discovery during the following scenarios and stages:

* **Initial Reconnaissance and Discovery Phase**: Immediately after gaining initial access, attackers seek to understand the victim’s environment and identify high-value targets.
* **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation**: Bookmark data can reveal internal applications, portals, and administrative interfaces, facilitating lateral movement and privilege escalation.
* **Targeted Phishing Campaigns**: Bookmarks often indicate user interests and critical resources, allowing attackers to craft highly personalized and convincing phishing emails.
* **Persistence and Long-Term Access**: Attackers may periodically extract bookmarks to monitor changes in organizational resources, identifying new opportunities for exploitation or lateral movement.
* **Data Exfiltration Planning**: Understanding internal resources helps attackers identify valuable data repositories and plan efficient data exfiltration methods.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Organizations can detect Browser Bookmark Discovery through various methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Endpoint Monitoring and Detection Tools**:
  * Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions (CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black, Microsoft Defender ATP) can detect suspicious file access to bookmark files.
  * File integrity monitoring (FIM) tools can alert on unauthorized access or modification of bookmark files.
* **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection**:
  * Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms (Splunk, QRadar, Elastic Security) can detect unusual file access patterns or abnormal processes attempting to access browser data.
  * User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) can identify deviations from normal user behavior, such as unexpected access to browser files from uncommon processes or accounts.
* **Audit Logging and Monitoring**:
  * Monitor access to bookmark storage locations and databases using OS-level audit logging (Windows Event Logs, Linux auditd).
  * Track unusual process executions, especially scripts or command-line tools used to parse JSON or SQLite files.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Presence of unauthorized scripts or tools capable of parsing bookmark files.
  * Unusual access timestamps or file read events on bookmark files.
  * Evidence of bookmark file copies or transfers to external or temporary locations.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Browser Bookmark Discovery is critical for several reasons:

* **Prevention of Lateral Movement**: Bookmarks often contain internal URLs and administrative portals, making them valuable intelligence for lateral movement. Detecting early prevents attackers from leveraging this information.
* **Mitigation of Targeted Attacks**: Early detection helps prevent attackers from crafting targeted phishing campaigns or exploiting sensitive internal resources.
* **Protection of Sensitive Information**: Bookmarks may include confidential or sensitive URLs to internal applications, cloud services, or administrative interfaces, posing significant risks if compromised.
* **Avoiding Data Exfiltration**: Identifying this technique early prevents attackers from gaining insight into critical data repositories, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized data exfiltration.
* **Incident Containment and Response**: Detecting bookmark discovery activity allows security teams to promptly investigate, contain, and remediate incidents before attackers escalate privileges or cause extensive damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating Browser Bookmark Discovery include:

* **APT Groups and Nation-State Actors**:
  * Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups frequently utilize bookmark discovery techniques during initial reconnaissance phases to identify sensitive internal resources within targeted organizations.
  * APT29 (Cozy Bear) and APT28 (Fancy Bear) have been known to leverage browser artifacts, including bookmarks, to enhance reconnaissance and lateral movement capabilities.
* **Red Team and Penetration Testing Tools**:
  * Metasploit Framework includes modules for extracting browser bookmarks from compromised systems, demonstrating the ease of automating this technique.
  * Cobalt Strike and Empire frameworks provide capabilities for bookmark extraction as part of post-exploitation activities, widely used by penetration testers and adversaries alike.
* **Commodity Malware and Infostealers**:
  * Infostealer malware variants such as RedLine Stealer, Vidar, and Raccoon Stealer routinely target browser bookmarks to harvest sensitive URLs, credentials, and user interests for monetization or further exploitation.
  * Credential harvesting malware often includes bookmark extraction functionality to identify high-value targets like banking portals, cloud services, and internal corporate resources.
* **Incident Case Studies**:
  * During the SolarWinds supply chain compromise, adversaries leveraged browser data, including bookmarks, to identify internal resources and facilitate lateral movement within victim networks.
  * Investigations into ransomware incidents often reveal attackers initially extracting browser bookmarks to identify critical internal applications, file shares, and cloud storage locations for targeted encryption and extortion efforts.

# Cloud Service Discovery

## Information

* Name: Cloud Service Discovery
* ID: T1526
* Tactics: [TA0007](./)

## Introduction

Cloud Service Discovery is a technique categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework (Technique ID: T1526), falling under the tactic of Discovery. Attackers perform Cloud Service Discovery to identify cloud infrastructure resources, services, configurations, and permissions. This technique involves enumerating information about cloud environments, such as virtual machines, storage buckets, databases, APIs, users, roles, and privileges. Understanding the cloud environment helps attackers map the infrastructure, identify potential attack vectors, and plan subsequent stages of an attack effectively.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Cloud Service Discovery involves systematically enumerating cloud services and configurations to gain insight into the target environment. Attackers typically use legitimate cloud service APIs, command-line interfaces (CLI), or web-based consoles to perform reconnaissance. Key technical execution methods include:

* **Cloud Provider APIs**:
  * Attackers leverage RESTful APIs provided by cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) to enumerate services and resources.
  * APIs often require authentication tokens or credentials, which attackers may have obtained via credential theft, phishing, or compromised instances.
  * API calls frequently used include:
    * AWS: `DescribeInstances`, `ListBuckets`, `ListUsers`, `DescribeSecurityGroups`
    * Azure: `az vm list`, `az storage account list`, `az role assignment list`
    * Google Cloud: `gcloud compute instances list`, `gsutil ls`, `gcloud projects get-iam-policy`
* **Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)**:
  * Attackers use official cloud provider CLIs (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud SDK) installed on compromised hosts or attacker-controlled machines.
  * CLI commands simplify resource enumeration and automate discovery processes.
* **Web-based Cloud Consoles**:
  * Attackers may directly access cloud management consoles through compromised user credentials.
  * Web consoles provide comprehensive visibility into cloud infrastructure and permissions.
* **Third-party Tools and Frameworks**:
  * Automated reconnaissance tools such as CloudSploit, ScoutSuite, Pacu, CloudMapper, and CloudBrute are commonly employed to streamline cloud service discovery.
  * These tools automate enumeration, privilege mapping, and vulnerability identification.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Cloud Service Discovery typically occurs during the reconnaissance stage of an attack lifecycle. Attackers perform this technique to gather intelligence and map the cloud infrastructure before launching further attacks. Common attack scenarios and stages include:

* **Initial Reconnaissance**:
  * Attackers enumerate cloud resources immediately after gaining initial foothold or credentials.
  * Helps attackers understand the scale, complexity, and security posture of the cloud environment.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:
  * Enumerating IAM permissions, roles, and policies helps attackers identify opportunities for privilege escalation.
  * Identifying cloud resources and their relationships allows attackers to pivot between services and accounts.
* **Data Exfiltration and Persistence**:
  * Attackers identify storage buckets, databases, and repositories containing sensitive data.
  * Mapping backup mechanisms and logging infrastructure helps attackers evade detection and maintain persistence.
* **Resource Hijacking and Abuse**:
  * Attackers discover compute resources and services that can be leveraged for cryptomining, denial-of-service (DoS), or hosting malware payloads.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Cloud Service Discovery involves monitoring cloud environments for unusual API calls, anomalous activity patterns, and unauthorized access attempts. Key detection methods, tools, and indicators include:

* **Cloud Provider Logging and Monitoring Tools**:
  * AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, Google Cloud Audit Logs capture API calls and actions performed within cloud environments.
  * Monitor for unusual or high-volume enumeration API calls from unfamiliar IP addresses or unexpected user accounts.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems**:
  * SIEM solutions (Splunk, Elastic Security, IBM QRadar) aggregate and analyze cloud logs for anomalies, suspicious patterns, and unauthorized enumeration attempts.
  * Create detection rules to identify repeated enumeration queries or attempts to list resources across multiple services.
* **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Tools**:
  * CSPM solutions (Palo Alto Prisma Cloud, Aqua Security, Check Point CloudGuard) continuously monitor cloud infrastructure to detect unauthorized resource discovery and configuration changes.
* **Behavioral Analytics and Machine Learning**:
  * Behavioral analytics solutions detect deviations from normal baseline activities, such as sudden enumeration queries or extensive resource listing.
  * Machine learning models can identify anomalous patterns indicative of reconnaissance activities.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unusual API calls such as frequent `ListBuckets`, `DescribeInstances`, or IAM enumeration (`ListUsers`, `ListRoles`) from unexpected or suspicious accounts.
  * Multiple failed or unauthorized API calls indicating attempts to discover resources without proper permissions.
  * API calls originating from unknown geographical regions or IP addresses.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Cloud Service Discovery is critical due to the significant risks and impacts associated with attackers gaining detailed knowledge of cloud infrastructure. Possible impacts and importance of detection include:

* **Preventing Further Attacks**:
  * Early identification of reconnaissance activities allows security teams to proactively respond before attackers escalate privileges, move laterally, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
* **Protecting Sensitive Data**:
  * Timely detection prevents attackers from identifying critical data repositories, storage buckets, and databases containing sensitive information, thereby safeguarding intellectual property and customer data.
* **Minimizing Resource Abuse**:
  * Detection helps prevent attackers from discovering and abusing cloud resources for cryptomining, DoS attacks, or malware distribution, reducing operational disruptions and associated costs.
* **Reducing Attack Dwell Time**:
  * Immediate identification of reconnaissance activities significantly reduces attacker dwell time, limiting the scope and severity of security breaches.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**:
  * Detection and response to unauthorized cloud enumeration activities help organizations meet compliance and regulatory obligations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS), avoiding legal penalties and reputational damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating Cloud Service Discovery include:

* **Capital One Data Breach (2019)**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Attacker exploited a misconfigured AWS IAM role to obtain credentials and enumerate AWS cloud resources.
  * **Tools Used**: AWS CLI, custom scripts to enumerate S3 buckets and EC2 instances.
  * **Impact**: Exfiltration of personal information of over 100 million customers, significant financial and reputational damages.
* **TeamTNT Cryptomining Attacks (2020-2021)**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Attackers compromised cloud instances and leveraged cloud APIs to enumerate additional cloud resources for cryptomining operations.
  * **Tools Used**: Automated scripts, AWS CLI, Docker APIs, Kubernetes APIs.
  * **Impact**: Unauthorized resource consumption, increased cloud infrastructure costs, performance degradation of cloud services.
* **Tesla Kubernetes Breach (2018)**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Attackers gained access to Tesla's Kubernetes console due to an unsecured administrative dashboard and enumerated cloud resources.
  * **Tools Used**: Kubernetes API, AWS CLI, cryptomining scripts.
  * **Impact**: Unauthorized cryptomining activities, exposure of sensitive cloud infrastructure details, increased operational costs.
* **Docker Hub Breach (2019)**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Attackers compromised Docker Hub credentials and enumerated Docker container repositories and cloud resources.
  * **Tools Used**: Docker APIs, cloud enumeration tools.
  * **Impact**: Exposure of sensitive container images, potential risks to downstream users and organizations using Docker images.

These examples illustrate the importance of detecting Cloud Service Discovery techniques early to mitigate potential impacts and prevent further exploitation.

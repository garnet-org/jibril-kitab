# Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion

## Information

* Name: Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
* ID: T1497
* Tactics: [TA0005](../../ta0005/), [TA0007](../)
* Sub-Technique: [T1497.001](t1497.001.md), [T1497.003](t1497.003.md), [T1497.002](t1497.002.md)

## Introduction

Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework as technique T1497. This technique involves adversaries intentionally detecting and evading virtualized environments or sandbox analysis systems to prevent detection and analysis. Attackers use various methods to identify if their malicious payload is running inside a virtual machine (VM), sandbox, or analysis environment, and subsequently alter their behavior or terminate execution to avoid detection and analysis.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion typically involves methods designed to detect and bypass virtualized environments or sandbox analysis systems. Attackers commonly use the following execution methods and mechanisms:

* **Hardware and Environment Checks:**
  * Checking system hardware attributes (CPU cores, RAM size, hard disk space) to detect virtualization.
  * Identifying hardware vendor strings or BIOS information associated with virtualized environments (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, Xen, Hyper-V).
* **Registry and File System Inspection:**
  * Searching specific registry keys or file paths indicative of virtual machines or sandbox environments (e.g., VMware Tools registry entries, sandbox-specific files, virtual device drivers).
* **Process and Service Enumeration:**
  * Enumerating running processes or services typical of virtualization tools (e.g., "vmtoolsd.exe", "vboxservice.exe").
  * Checking for sandbox-specific processes or analysis tools running in memory.
* **Timing and Performance Analysis:**
  * Measuring execution time of specific instructions or API calls to detect abnormal delays indicative of sandbox or VM environments.
  * Utilizing timing-based checks to detect discrepancies caused by virtualization overhead.
* **Network and MAC Address Inspection:**
  * Inspecting MAC addresses for known virtual machine prefixes.
  * Checking for network adapter names and configurations associated with virtualized environments.
* **Memory and Instruction Checks:**
  * Leveraging specific CPU instructions (e.g., CPUID) to detect virtualization flags.
  * Analyzing memory allocation anomalies typical within virtualized environments.

Real-world procedures often involve malware performing these checks at runtime, immediately terminating or modifying behavior if virtualization or sandbox environments are detected.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is predominantly used in the following attack scenarios and stages:

* **Initial Access and Execution:**
  * During initial payload execution, attackers may perform sandbox checks to avoid detection by automated analysis systems before delivering secondary payloads.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Malware authors implement these techniques to evade security analysis and automated detection mechanisms, ensuring persistence and stealth.
* **Malware Delivery and Exploitation:**
  * Attackers use evasion techniques during targeted attacks to prevent researchers and security analysts from easily analyzing or reverse-engineering their malware.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Campaigns:**
  * APT groups frequently employ virtualization evasion to maintain operational security and avoid attribution.
* **Ransomware Attacks:**
  * Ransomware operators commonly integrate sandbox evasion to prevent security solutions from detecting and mitigating attacks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs) for identifying Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion include:

* **Behavioral Analysis and Monitoring:**
  * Monitoring suspicious API calls related to hardware enumeration, registry queries, and file system inspection.
  * Analyzing repeated queries for virtualization-specific registry keys or file paths.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**
  * Employing EDR tools to detect suspicious process enumeration, timing checks, and hardware inspection behaviors.
  * Identifying processes that terminate abruptly after detecting virtualization indicators.
* **Sandbox and Honeypot Solutions:**
  * Utilizing advanced sandbox environments designed to mimic real-world systems and detect malware evasion attempts.
  * Implementing anti-evasion techniques such as randomized hardware identifiers or timing adjustments.
* **Network Monitoring and Analysis:**
  * Monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns or queries indicative of sandbox detection attempts.
  * Identifying MAC address enumeration or network adapter queries associated with virtualization detection.
* **Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis:**
  * Performing static analysis to identify code segments designed for virtualization detection.
  * Dynamic analysis using specialized tools (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.Run, Hybrid Analysis) to detect runtime evasion behaviors.

Specific IoCs indicating Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion include:

* Registry key queries targeting virtualization software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox).
* File system queries for virtualization-specific files (e.g., "VBoxGuestAdditions.iso", "vmtools.dll").
* API calls such as "GetTickCount", "QueryPerformanceCounter", or "CPUID" with virtualization-related parameters.
* Network adapter enumeration targeting known virtual machine MAC address prefixes.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Timely detection of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is crucial due to the following impacts on systems and networks:

* **Reduced Visibility and Detection Capabilities:**
  * Malware that successfully evades sandbox analysis can bypass automated detection mechanisms, increasing the risk of infection and persistence.
* **Increased Attack Success and Persistence:**
  * Successful evasion allows attackers to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and conduct lateral movement without detection.
* **Difficulty in Incident Response and Analysis:**
  * Malware that evades sandbox and virtualization analysis complicates forensic analysis, incident response, and threat hunting efforts.
* **Potential for Data Exfiltration and Damage:**
  * Undetected malware can lead to extended dwell time, enabling attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, deploy ransomware, or disrupt critical infrastructure.
* **Increased Cost and Resource Utilization:**
  * Failure to detect evasion techniques early can result in prolonged incident response, remediation efforts, and higher associated costs.

Therefore, early detection and mitigation of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion techniques are essential for maintaining organizational security posture, reducing risk exposure, and minimizing potential damage.

# Application Exhaustion Flood

## Information

* Name: Application Exhaustion Flood
* ID: T1499.003
* Tactics: [TA0040](../)
* Technique: [T1499](./)

## Introduction

Application Exhaustion Flood (T1499.003) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized within the Impact tactic. It involves overwhelming an application or service with excessive requests or resource-intensive actions to exhaust available resources, resulting in degraded performance or complete denial-of-service (DoS). Attackers leverage this method primarily to disrupt availability and negatively impact operational continuity of targeted systems.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

This sub-technique involves attackers sending a high volume of legitimate-looking requests or resource-intensive tasks to an application, causing resource exhaustion and denial-of-service conditions. Unlike volumetric network floods, application exhaustion floods specifically target the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model), making them difficult to mitigate using standard network-layer defenses.

Typical execution methods and mechanisms include:

* **HTTP/HTTPS Request Flooding:**
  * Attackers send numerous HTTP requests that consume significant server resources.
  * Examples include repeated database queries, complex search requests, or resource-intensive page loads.
* **Slowloris Attack:**
  * Attackers keep HTTP connections open by sending partial requests at regular intervals, quickly consuming available connection pools.
* **Resource-Intensive API Calls:**
  * Attackers repeatedly invoke APIs that trigger heavy computation or database operations, draining server resources.
* **Authentication Exhaustion:**
  * Attackers send numerous authentication attempts to consume resources allocated for authentication processes.

Real-world procedures often include:

* Utilizing botnets or distributed attacker-controlled hosts to generate high-volume traffic.
* Exploiting legitimate application features or endpoints that inherently consume considerable resources.
* Crafting requests specifically designed to trigger expensive backend computations or database operations.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ Application Exhaustion Flooding in scenarios such as:

* **Disrupting Availability:**
  * Attackers aim to cause service outages, impacting business continuity or public-facing services.
  * Often used by hacktivists or competitors aiming to damage reputation or financial stability.
* **Diversionary Tactics:**
  * Attackers use exhaustion floods as distractions to mask other malicious activities, such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
* **Extortion and Ransom Demands:**
  * Criminal groups or threat actors may initiate floods to pressure victims into paying ransoms for restoring service availability.

Attack stages where this technique commonly appears:

* **Initial Access:**
  * Attackers may use exhaustion floods to disrupt authentication or authorization mechanisms, facilitating unauthorized entry.
* **Impact Stage:**
  * Primarily employed to directly impact systems and cause operational disruption.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Application Exhaustion Floods typically involves monitoring application behavior, resource utilization, and network traffic patterns. Effective detection methods and indicators include:

* **Behavioral Monitoring:**
  * Sudden spikes in application resource usage (CPU, memory, database queries).
  * Unusual patterns of repeated, resource-intensive requests from individual IP addresses or user agents.
* **Traffic Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**
  * Tools such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions can identify anomalous request rates or patterns.
  * Detection of Slowloris-type attacks by identifying incomplete or prolonged HTTP sessions.
* **Rate Limiting and Threshold Alerts:**
  * Setting thresholds for maximum allowed requests per IP or user within specific timeframes.
  * Automatic alerts triggered by exceeding predefined resource utilization thresholds.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

* Unusual number of HTTP status codes indicating server overload (e.g., HTTP 503 Service Unavailable).
* High frequency of incomplete or partial HTTP requests.
* Elevated database or backend server response times correlated with specific endpoints or request patterns.
* Repeated requests originating from suspicious IP addresses or known malicious infrastructure.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Application Exhaustion Floods is crucial due to their significant impact on organizational operations and infrastructure availability. Possible impacts include:

* **Service Downtime:**
  * Prolonged outages can severely impact customer satisfaction, revenue, and organizational reputation.
* **Resource Depletion and Performance Degradation:**
  * Excessive resource consumption can lead to cascading failures across dependent services or infrastructure components.
* **Financial and Operational Costs:**
  * Organizations incur costs associated with emergency remediation efforts, infrastructure scaling, and potential regulatory fines.
* **Security Posture Weakening:**
  * Attackers may leverage exhaustion floods to distract security teams, facilitating other malicious activities such as data breaches or unauthorized access.

Early detection enables organizations to:

* Rapidly initiate mitigation and remediation measures, minimizing downtime and operational disruption.
* Strengthen overall security posture by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.
* Reduce financial losses and protect organizational reputation by maintaining service availability and reliability.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Application Exhaustion Flood (T1499.003) include:

* **Slowloris Attack Against Iranian Government Websites (2009):**
  * Attackers utilized the Slowloris tool to maintain multiple incomplete HTTP connections, exhausting available connection pools on targeted Iranian government servers.
  * Resulted in prolonged downtime and reduced availability of government web services.
* **Operation Ababil DDoS Attacks on Financial Institutions (2012-2013):**
  * Attackers launched sustained application-layer DDoS attacks against major financial institutions, sending resource-intensive HTTPS requests.
  * Attackers employed botnets and custom scripts to flood banking web applications, causing significant disruption to online banking services and customer access.
* **Mirai Botnet HTTP Floods (2016 onwards):**
  * Mirai malware-infected IoT devices generated massive HTTP floods targeting application-layer resources, overwhelming web servers and causing outages.
  * High-profile targets included online gaming platforms, hosting providers, and DNS providers, resulting in substantial operational disruption and financial losses.

Tools commonly used in Application Exhaustion Flood attacks:

* **Slowloris:** Tool designed to open multiple slow HTTP connections, exhausting server connection pools.
* **LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon):** Popular tool among hacktivists to generate high-volume HTTP requests aimed at overwhelming web servers.
* **HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon):** Advanced version of LOIC, capable of generating more complex and resource-intensive HTTP floods.
* **Custom scripts and botnets:** Attackers frequently leverage custom-developed scripts or commandeer botnets to amplify attack volume and complexity.

Impacts observed from these examples:

* Significant service downtime and customer dissatisfaction.
* Financial losses due to operational disruption and remediation efforts.
* Damage to organizational reputation and trust among customers and stakeholders.

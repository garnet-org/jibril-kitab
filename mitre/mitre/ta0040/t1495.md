# Firmware Corruption

## Information

* Name: Firmware Corruption
* ID: T1495
* Tactics: [TA0040](./)

## Introduction

Firmware Corruption is categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework as technique T1495. It involves adversaries intentionally modifying, corrupting, or overwriting firmware within targeted systems. Firmware is low-level software embedded directly into hardware components, responsible for initializing hardware and providing runtime services. Corruption or manipulation of firmware can enable attackers to maintain persistence, evade detection, gain deeper system control, or cause permanent denial of service (DoS) conditions.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Firmware corruption involves altering or overwriting the firmware stored in non-volatile memory, such as EEPROM, SPI flash, BIOS chips, or other embedded storage media. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in firmware update mechanisms, insecure boot processes, or insufficient validation checks to implant malicious code or corrupt existing firmware.

Technical execution methods include:

* **Firmware Update Abuse**:
  * Exploiting insecure firmware update processes.
  * Intercepting legitimate firmware updates and injecting malicious payloads.
  * Leveraging weak cryptographic verification or lack of signature checks.
* **Direct Memory Access (DMA) Attacks**:
  * Utilizing DMA vulnerabilities to directly overwrite firmware storage regions.
  * Employing external hardware or compromised peripherals to manipulate firmware memory.
* **Supply Chain Attacks**:
  * Pre-installing corrupted firmware during manufacturing or distribution.
  * Compromising firmware images available on vendor websites or update repositories.
* **Remote Exploitation**:
  * Exploiting network-exposed firmware update mechanisms or management interfaces.
  * Using remote code execution vulnerabilities to corrupt firmware remotely.

Real-world procedures often involve:

* Identifying firmware vulnerabilities through reverse engineering or public disclosures.
* Crafting malicious firmware images or patches.
* Delivering malicious firmware via spear-phishing, watering hole attacks, or compromised update channels.
* Executing malicious firmware updates silently to maintain persistence and evade detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Firmware corruption can appear across multiple stages and scenarios of an attack lifecycle, notably:

* **Persistence**:
  * Attackers embed malicious code directly in firmware to persist across reboots, OS reinstalls, or hardware resets.
* **Privilege Escalation**:
  * Corrupted firmware can allow attackers to bypass OS-level security controls, gaining higher privileges.
* **Defense Evasion**:
  * Firmware-level implants evade traditional antivirus, endpoint detection, and response (EDR) solutions, which typically focus on OS-level threats.
* **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
  * Corrupting firmware intentionally to render devices permanently inoperable or degrade performance.
* **Supply Chain Attacks**:
  * Introducing corrupt firmware during manufacturing or distribution to target specific organizations or sectors.
* **Espionage and Long-Term Surveillance**:
  * Nation-state actors implant malicious firmware for covert, long-term monitoring and data exfiltration.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of firmware corruption is challenging due to its low-level nature. Common detection methods include:

* **Firmware Integrity Verification**:
  * Periodic cryptographic checks (hashing, digital signatures) against known good firmware baselines.
  * Secure boot mechanisms that verify firmware integrity at boot time.
* **Behavioral Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**:
  * Monitoring firmware update events for unusual timing, sources, or frequency.
  * Identifying anomalous hardware behavior, such as unexpected reboots, instability, or performance degradation.
* **Hardware and Firmware Auditing Tools**:
  * Specialized utilities (e.g., CHIPSEC, Intel Boot Guard) that analyze firmware integrity and configurations.
  * Firmware extraction and forensic analysis tools to detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unrecognized firmware versions or unexpected firmware downgrade events.
  * Unusual firmware update logs or suspicious entries in hardware event logs.
  * Presence of unauthorized firmware update tools or utilities.
  * Network traffic anomalies associated with firmware update mechanisms.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of firmware corruption is crucial due to the severe impacts it can cause:

* **Persistence and Long-Term Compromise**:
  * Malicious firmware implants can survive reinstallation of operating systems, standard software updates, and even hardware resets.
* **System Instability and Permanent Damage**:
  * Corrupted firmware can cause hardware failure, permanent denial of service, or irreversible damage to critical components.
* **Evasion of Traditional Security Controls**:
  * Firmware-level attacks bypass conventional endpoint protection, antivirus software, and operating system-based security measures.
* **High Privilege Access and Control**:
  * Firmware corruption provides attackers with deep-level access, enabling full control over hardware and sensitive data.
* **Supply Chain Risks**:
  * Compromised firmware can propagate through supply chains, affecting numerous downstream organizations and systems.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Implications**:
  * Undetected firmware corruption can lead to regulatory non-compliance, data breaches, and significant financial and reputational damage.

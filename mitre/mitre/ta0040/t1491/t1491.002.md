# External Defacement

## Information

* Name: External Defacement
* ID: T1491.002
* Tactics: [TA0040](../)
* Technique: [T1491](./)

## Introduction

External Defacement (T1491.002) is a sub-technique of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the tactic "Impact." This technique involves unauthorized modification or defacement of publicly accessible websites or online services, typically to cause reputational harm, spread political or ideological messages, or demonstrate attacker capabilities. Attackers commonly exploit vulnerabilities in web applications, content management systems (CMS), or hosting infrastructure to alter web content visibly and publicly.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

External Defacement involves attackers gaining unauthorized access to a web server or web application and modifying or replacing the original content with malicious or inappropriate content. Attackers typically use the following methods to achieve external defacement:

* **Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities:**
  * SQL injection vulnerabilities to obtain admin credentials or directly alter database-stored content.
  * Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allowing insertion of malicious scripts or redirects.
  * Remote file inclusion (RFI) and local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code or upload malicious files.
* **Credential Theft and Brute Force Attacks:**
  * Using stolen or leaked credentials to access administrative interfaces.
  * Performing brute force or dictionary attacks to compromise administrator accounts.
* **Server Misconfigurations and Weak Security Practices:**
  * Poorly configured file permissions allowing unauthorized uploads or modifications.
  * Outdated or unpatched CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Joomla, Drupal) vulnerable to known exploits.
* **DNS Hijacking:**
  * Attackers compromising DNS records to redirect legitimate site traffic to attacker-controlled servers displaying defaced content.

Attackers often leave visible messages or signatures, including political statements, ideological propaganda, or individualized hacker tags, making defacement easily recognizable.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

External Defacement typically occurs in the following scenarios and attack stages:

* **Hacktivism and Ideological Campaigns:**
  * Attackers seeking to spread political, social, or ideological messages by defacing high-profile websites.
  * Used as a form of protest or propaganda.
* **Cyber Warfare and Nation-State Sponsored Attacks:**
  * Nation-states or sponsored groups defacing government or critical infrastructure websites to disseminate propaganda or misinformation.
  * Psychological operations aimed at undermining trust and stability.
* **Cybercriminal Groups Demonstrating Capabilities:**
  * Groups or individuals showcasing their technical skills or gaining notoriety by defacing popular or highly visible websites.
* **Initial Stages of Broader Cyber Attacks:**
  * Defacement may serve as a distraction or smokescreen for more severe attacks occurring simultaneously.
  * Attackers testing access and persistence on compromised infrastructure.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of External Defacement typically involves:

* **Continuous Website Monitoring:**
  * Regular automated monitoring of website content for unexpected changes.
  * Use of integrity-checking tools (e.g., Tripwire, OSSEC) to detect unauthorized file modifications.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**
  * Monitoring traffic patterns and requests to detect unusual activity indicative of attempted exploits.
  * Identifying payloads associated with common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, RFI/LFI).
* **Log Analysis and Alerting:**
  * Regular review of web server logs, application logs, and security logs for suspicious access patterns or unauthorized administrative logins.
  * Automated alerts triggered by anomalies in file access or modification timestamps.
* **DNS Monitoring:**
  * Monitoring DNS records for unauthorized changes indicative of DNS hijacking attacks.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unexpected or unauthorized file uploads (e.g., new scripts, images, HTML pages).
  * Altered or replaced homepage, index files, or web page content.
  * Suspicious administrative logins from unfamiliar IP addresses or geographic locations.
  * Presence of known defacement scripts or attacker signatures within website files.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of External Defacement is critical due to the following potential impacts:

* **Damage to Organizational Reputation:**
  * Defacement visibly undermines trust and credibility with customers, partners, and the general public.
  * Negative media coverage and social media backlash can significantly harm brand reputation.
* **Loss of Customer Confidence:**
  * Customers may perceive defacement as indicative of broader security issues, leading to reduced trust, loss of business, and financial impact.
* **Indicator of Deeper Security Breaches:**
  * Web defacement often indicates underlying vulnerabilities or security gaps that attackers may exploit further.
  * Early detection allows organizations to remediate vulnerabilities before attackers escalate privileges or deploy more harmful payloads.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Consequences:**
  * Defacement incidents may trigger regulatory scrutiny, legal action, or compliance violations, especially in regulated industries.
* **Operational Disruption and Financial Loss:**
  * Recovery efforts, incident response, and restoring original content can be resource-intensive, costly, and disruptive to business operations.

## Examples

Real-world examples of External Defacement incidents include:

* **Operation Ababil (2012-2013):**
  * Attackers, allegedly linked to hacktivist groups, defaced multiple financial institution websites with political and ideological messages.
  * Impact included significant reputational damage, operational disruptions, and substantial remediation costs.
* **Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) Attacks (2013-2014):**
  * SEA defaced prominent media websites (e.g., Forbes, BBC, The Guardian) to broadcast political messages supporting the Syrian government.
  * Utilized phishing attacks and credential theft to gain administrative access and alter website content.
* **Anonymous Hacktivist Campaigns:**
  * Anonymous defaced numerous government and corporate websites to protest political decisions or perceived injustices.
  * Attackers commonly used automated scanners, exploit kits, and known vulnerabilities in outdated CMS platforms.
* **Philippines Government Website Defacement (2016):**
  * Hacktivist group defaced numerous Philippine government websites to protest political issues.
  * Attackers exploited outdated CMS systems and weak administrative credentials to gain access and modify content.

These examples demonstrate the diverse motivations, techniques, and impacts associated with External Defacement attacks, highlighting the importance of proactive defense measures, continuous monitoring, and rapid incident response capabilities.

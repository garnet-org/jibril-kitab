# InstallUtil

## Information

* Name: InstallUtil
* ID: T1218.004
* Tactics: [TA0005](../)
* Technique: [T1218](./)

## Introduction

InstallUtil (T1218.004) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the parent technique "Signed Binary Proxy Execution" (T1218). This sub-technique involves adversaries abusing the legitimate Microsoft .NET utility InstallUtil.exe to execute malicious payloads. InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows installation and uninstallation of resources by executing installer components embedded within .NET assemblies. Attackers exploit this legitimate functionality to evade detection, bypass application whitelisting, and execute arbitrary code on targeted systems.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

InstallUtil.exe is a legitimate Microsoft .NET framework utility designed to handle installation and uninstallation processes for .NET assemblies. This utility is typically found in the following directories:

* `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\<version>\InstallUtil.exe`
* `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\<version>\InstallUtil.exe`

Attackers leverage InstallUtil.exe by embedding malicious code within .NET assemblies and then executing them via InstallUtil. This execution method is particularly effective because:

* InstallUtil.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft, making it trusted by default in many environments.
* It can bypass application whitelisting controls due to its legitimate purpose and Microsoft-signed binary status.
* It executes code within the context of a trusted Microsoft binary, making detection and attribution more difficult.

Typical malicious usage of InstallUtil.exe involves the following steps:

1. Adversaries create or obtain a malicious .NET assembly containing installer components (`InstallUtil` compatible).
2. Malicious code is embedded within the `Install()` or `Uninstall()` methods of the assembly.
3.  Adversaries execute the malicious assembly using the command:

    ```
    InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false /U path\to\malicious.dll
    ```
4. Upon execution, the embedded malicious code runs silently, performing actions such as downloading payloads, establishing persistence, or escalating privileges.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique is typically employed during several stages of the attack lifecycle, including:

* **Initial Access**: Attackers may use InstallUtil.exe to execute initial payloads after gaining initial footholds through phishing, malicious downloads, or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
* **Execution**: Utilizing InstallUtil.exe allows adversaries to execute arbitrary code on compromised systems without raising suspicion, leveraging trusted binaries.
* **Persistence**: Attackers can use InstallUtil.exe during persistence creation by embedding malicious installer components that ensure malicious code runs at system startup or scheduled intervals.
* **Defense Evasion**: InstallUtil.exe is frequently leveraged to bypass application whitelisting, antivirus solutions, and other endpoint security measures due to its legitimate status and trusted signature.
* **Privilege Escalation**: Malicious assemblies executed via InstallUtil.exe may contain code designed to escalate privileges, allowing attackers to gain administrative or system-level permissions.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of InstallUtil.exe misuse requires monitoring and analyzing system behaviors, logs, and artifacts. Common detection methods include:

* **Process Monitoring**:
  * Monitor execution of InstallUtil.exe from uncommon locations or with unusual command-line arguments (e.g., `/logfile=`, `/LogToConsole=false`, `/U`).
  * Track instances where InstallUtil.exe executes unsigned or suspicious .NET assemblies.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  * Employ EDR tools capable of detecting suspicious process behaviors, anomalous command-line executions, and unexpected parent-child process relationships involving InstallUtil.exe.
* **Application Whitelisting and Execution Control**:
  * Configure application control policies (such as AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control) to restrict the execution of InstallUtil.exe to authorized administrative contexts only.
* **Log Analysis and SIEM Integration**:
  * Regularly review Windows event logs, Sysmon logs, and EDR-generated alerts for suspicious InstallUtil.exe activity.
  * Correlate logs to identify unusual patterns such as execution from temporary directories or downloads folders.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  *   Suspicious command-line parameters:

      ```
      InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false /U malicious.dll
      ```
  * Execution from non-standard locations such as `%TEMP%`, `%APPDATA%`, or user directories.
  * Presence of suspicious .NET assemblies with embedded installer components not associated with legitimate software installations.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of InstallUtil.exe abuse is critical due to potential severe impacts on system integrity, security posture, and organizational operations. Importance includes:

* **Prevention of Malware Execution**:
  * Malicious payloads executed via InstallUtil.exe can facilitate malware infections, ransomware deployment, remote access trojans (RATs), and other advanced threats.
* **Defense Evasion Mitigation**:
  * Detecting execution of malicious code through legitimate binaries prevents attackers from successfully bypassing security controls, application whitelisting, and antivirus detection.
* **Reducing Persistence and Privilege Escalation**:
  * Timely detection prevents attackers from establishing persistence mechanisms or escalating privileges, limiting their ability to maintain long-term unauthorized access.
* **Incident Response and Containment**:
  * Early identification of InstallUtil.exe misuse enables quicker response, containment, and remediation of security incidents, minimizing damage and reducing recovery costs.
* **Protecting Sensitive Data**:
  * Preventing attackers from executing malicious payloads reduces the risk of data exfiltration, unauthorized data access, and intellectual property theft.

## Examples

Real-world examples and documented cases involving the abuse of InstallUtil.exe include:

* **FIN7 Cybercrime Group**:
  * FIN7 has leveraged InstallUtil.exe to execute malicious payloads embedded in .NET assemblies, bypassing endpoint security measures and establishing persistence on compromised systems.
  * Attackers used spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, ultimately executing malicious DLLs via InstallUtil.exe to install backdoors and steal payment card information.
* **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  * APT29 has utilized InstallUtil.exe to execute malicious payloads for initial access and persistence during targeted espionage campaigns.
  * The group embedded malicious code in .NET assemblies, executed via InstallUtil.exe, to download additional payloads, establish command-and-control (C2) channels, and evade traditional detection mechanisms.
* **Operation Cobalt Kitty**:
  * Attackers involved in Operation Cobalt Kitty executed malicious .NET assemblies using InstallUtil.exe to establish persistence and conduct lateral movement within victim networks.
  * The malicious assemblies executed by InstallUtil.exe facilitated data exfiltration, credential harvesting, and reconnaissance activities.

These examples illustrate the diverse use-cases and significant impacts associated with this sub-technique, highlighting the importance of robust detection and mitigation strategies.

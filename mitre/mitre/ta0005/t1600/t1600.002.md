# Disable Crypto Hardware

## Information

* Name: Disable Crypto Hardware
* ID: T1600.002
* Tactics: [TA0005](../)
* Technique: [T1600](./)

## Introduction

The sub-technique "Disable or Remove Encryption" (T1600.002) from the MITRE ATT\&CK framework refers to adversaries disabling or removing encryption protections on devices, file systems, or communications. Encryption is frequently employed by organizations to protect sensitive data at rest or in transit. Attackers, aware of this protective measure, seek to disable or eliminate encryption to enable easier access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of assets without being hindered by cryptographic safeguards.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers typically execute this sub-technique through various methods, including:

* **Disabling Disk Encryption Software:**
  * Attackers may disable encryption tools such as BitLocker (Windows), FileVault (macOS), or Linux-based LUKS to gain access to sensitive data stored on disk.
  *   Common commands or scripts are executed to disable or suspend encryption temporarily or permanently, such as using Windows' `manage-bde` command line tool:

      ```
      manage-bde -off C:
      ```
  * Attackers may also modify registry keys or configuration settings to prevent encryption from activating on reboot.
* **Removing or Disabling Encrypted Communications:**
  * Attackers may disable secure protocols such as TLS/SSL by modifying configurations, removing certificates, or downgrading mechanisms to plaintext protocols.
  * For instance, modifying web server configuration files (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to disable HTTPS and force HTTP communication, thus facilitating traffic interception and monitoring.
* **Disabling Application-Level Encryption:**
  * Attackers may disable encryption features built into applications or databases by altering their configuration files or settings.
  * For example, changing database server configurations to disable encryption at rest or in transit, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data easily.
* **Exploiting Administrative Privileges:**
  * Attackers typically require administrative or privileged access to disable encryption. Thus, this sub-technique usually follows privilege escalation or credential theft.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique commonly appears in several attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
  * After gaining initial foothold, attackers might disable encryption to facilitate easier data collection and reconnaissance.
* **Credential Access and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers who have obtained administrative privileges frequently disable encryption as a preparatory step for further attacks.
* **Data Exfiltration Stage:**
  * Attackers disable encryption protections prior to exfiltrating sensitive data, simplifying data retrieval and reducing complexity in handling encrypted data.
* **Ransomware Attacks:**
  * Some ransomware groups disable built-in encryption mechanisms to ensure their own encryption routines run efficiently and without interference.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods and indicators of compromise (IoCs) include:

* **Monitoring Encryption Status Changes:**
  * Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor and alert on any unexpected encryption status changes or disabled encryption services.
  * Event logs from BitLocker, FileVault, or LUKS should be monitored for unexpected disabling or suspension events.
* **Registry and Configuration Monitoring:**
  * Monitor registry keys on Windows systems related to encryption status (e.g., `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\BitLocker`).
  * Monitor configuration files on Linux or macOS for unauthorized changes related to encryption settings.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Network monitoring tools and IDS/IPS systems can detect downgrades from encrypted protocols (HTTPS, SMTPS) to plaintext protocols (HTTP, SMTP).
  * Implement alerts for sudden use of unencrypted protocols on servers or endpoints previously known to use encrypted communications.
* **Audit Logs and SIEM Integration:**
  * Integrate encryption-related audit events into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for real-time alerting and historical analysis.
  * Regularly review audit trails for suspicious patterns or anomalies related to encryption activities.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual execution of encryption management tools (`manage-bde`, `cryptsetup`, `fdesetup`) by unauthorized users.
  * Unexpected changes in encryption-related configuration files or registry keys.
  * Sudden appearance of plaintext network traffic in previously encrypted communication channels.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of this sub-technique is crucial due to the following potential impacts:

* **Data Exposure and Theft:**
  * Disabling encryption allows attackers to access and exfiltrate sensitive data, potentially leading to severe privacy breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
* **Increased Risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**
  * Removing encryption from communications significantly increases vulnerability to interception, data manipulation, and unauthorized disclosure.
* **Facilitation of Further Attacks:**
  * Disabling encryption simplifies attacker actions, enabling easier lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence within the compromised environment.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Violations:**
  * Organizations failing to maintain encryption standards risk regulatory non-compliance, resulting in legal consequences and financial penalties.
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Encryption removal or disabling can disrupt normal business operations, degrade security posture, and necessitate costly incident response and remediation efforts.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating this technique include:

* **DarkSide Ransomware Attack (Colonial Pipeline Incident, 2021):**
  * Attackers disabled security and encryption mechanisms on victim systems to facilitate rapid data encryption and exfiltration.
  * Impact included significant disruption of fuel supplies, highlighting critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
* **FIN7 Group Attacks:**
  * FIN7 has been known to disable encryption and security measures on compromised point-of-sale (POS) systems, enabling theft of payment card data.
  * Attackers used scripts and tools to disable encryption at rest, simplifying data retrieval.
* **APT Groups Targeting Secure Communications:**
  * Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors have compromised VPNs and secure communication platforms by disabling encryption and forcing plaintext communications, facilitating espionage and data interception.
* **NotPetya Malware (2017):**
  * NotPetya ransomware disabled encryption protections and security features on infected systems to rapidly encrypt data, causing massive operational disruption and financial losses globally.
* **Insider Threat Scenarios:**
  * Malicious insiders have been documented disabling encryption mechanisms to exfiltrate sensitive corporate or intellectual property data without triggering encryption-based security alerts.

These examples illustrate the critical importance of robust detection, monitoring, and response capabilities to mitigate the risks associated with disabling or removing encryption protections.

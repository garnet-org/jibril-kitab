# ROMMONkit

## Information

* Name: ROMMONkit
* ID: T1542.004
* Tactics: [TA0005](../), [TA0003](../../ta0003/)
* Technique: [T1542](./)

## Introduction

ROMMONkit ([T1542.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004/)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader category of "Pre-OS Boot" persistence. This method involves modifying the Cisco IOS Router ROM Monitor (ROMMON) firmware, which is responsible for bootstrapping the operating system on Cisco devices. Attackers leverage ROMMONkit to establish persistent access and control over network devices, maintaining their foothold even after device reboots or firmware updates.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

ROM Monitor (ROMMON) is a low-level bootstrap environment for Cisco IOS devices, providing basic functionality for device recovery, configuration, and booting processes. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or unauthorized access to modify ROMMON firmware, embedding malicious code directly into the device's bootloader. This modification allows the attacker to:

* Gain persistent, stealthy access to the device.
* Intercept, monitor, or manipulate traffic passing through the router.
* Maintain persistence even after standard software updates or reboots, as ROMMON firmware typically remains unchanged during regular device operations.
* Avoid detection by traditional security tools that focus primarily on higher-level OS and application layers.

Execution methods typically involve:

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS software or hardware to gain initial access.
* Using administrative privileges to upload and install malicious ROMMON firmware images.
* Employing specialized tools or scripts (such as ROMMONkit) to automate the modification and deployment process.

Mechanisms attackers utilize include:

* Direct firmware manipulation through administrative interfaces or command-line access.
* Exploitation of weak authentication mechanisms or default credentials.
* Leveraging supply-chain attacks to compromise firmware images prior to deployment.

Real-world procedures involve attackers first gaining privileged access, then uploading a modified ROMMON firmware image, rebooting the device into the compromised ROMMON environment, and subsequently having persistent access for future exploitation or data exfiltration.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically use ROMMONkit during specific scenarios and attack phases, including:

* Maintaining long-term persistence after initial compromise of network infrastructure.
* Conducting stealthy espionage operations against critical infrastructure or sensitive enterprise networks.
* Targeting network devices such as routers and switches, where persistent access at the firmware level provides maximum stealth and control.
* Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns where attackers require sustained access and avoid detection through traditional security measures.
* Supply-chain attacks, embedding malicious firmware during manufacturing or distribution phases to affect multiple victims simultaneously.

This technique typically appears in the persistence and defense evasion stages of a cyberattack lifecycle.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of ROMMONkit and related firmware-level modifications is challenging but achievable through multiple methods:

* Regular integrity checks and firmware verification procedures:
  * Comparing running firmware images against known good hashes provided by Cisco.
  * Utilizing Cisco IOS commands such as `show version`, `show platform`, and `verify` commands to detect anomalies or unauthorized firmware.
* Network monitoring and anomaly detection:
  * Monitoring device boot logs and system logs for unexpected reboots or firmware reloads.
  * Observing unusual network traffic patterns or unauthorized connections originating from network devices.
* Advanced security tools and threat detection systems:
  * Firmware integrity monitoring systems (FIM) or specialized tools designed to detect firmware tampering.
  * Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions configured for network devices.
* Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
  * Unexpected ROMMON version numbers or firmware images.
  * Unexplained device resets or boot sequence anomalies.
  * Modified firmware hash values differing from vendor-provided baseline.
  * Presence of unknown or unauthorized administrative users or sessions on network devices.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting ROMMONkit and firmware-level compromises is critical due to its severe potential impacts:

* Persistent and stealthy attacker presence:
  * Attackers can maintain control indefinitely, even after standard remediation steps like software updates or system reboots.
* Network traffic interception and manipulation:
  * Attackers can intercept sensitive information, modify communications, or redirect network traffic to malicious destinations.
* Data exfiltration and espionage:
  * Persistent firmware-level access enables attackers to exfiltrate sensitive or proprietary data unnoticed.
* Operational disruption and sabotage:
  * Malicious firmware modifications can disrupt critical network infrastructure, causing significant operational downtime or damage.
* Increased difficulty of remediation:
  * Firmware-level compromise often requires extensive recovery procedures, including full firmware replacement or hardware swaps, significantly increasing recovery time and costs.

Early detection allows organizations to minimize these risks by:

* Quickly isolating and remediating compromised devices.
* Preventing further lateral movement or escalation within the network.
* Limiting the scope and severity of potential breaches or operational disruptions.

## Examples

Several real-world instances illustrate the use of ROMMONkit and similar firmware-level attacks:

* Cisco SYNful Knock Attack (2015):
  * Attackers compromised Cisco routers by modifying ROMMON firmware to implant persistent backdoors.
  * Attackers leveraged stolen administrative credentials to install malicious firmware images.
  * Impact included persistent and stealthy access, enabling attackers to intercept and redirect network traffic, exfiltrate data, and maintain long-term espionage capabilities.
* Shadow Brokers Leak (2016-2017):
  * Included leaked exploits and tools targeting Cisco routers, including firmware-level backdoors and ROMMON modifications.
  * Attackers employed specialized scripts and exploits to compromise firmware integrity, embedding persistent malware into targeted network infrastructure.
  * Resulted in widespread awareness of firmware-level vulnerabilities and increased focus on securing network devices against such attacks.
* Supply-chain firmware compromise scenarios:
  * Hypothetical or documented cases where attackers infiltrate manufacturing or distribution chains to embed malicious ROMMON firmware.
  * Potentially affecting large-scale deployments and multiple organizations simultaneously, leading to significant espionage and operational disruption risks.

These examples demonstrate the severity and sophistication of ROMMONkit attacks, highlighting the necessity for robust firmware integrity monitoring, regular security assessments, and timely detection and remediation strategies.

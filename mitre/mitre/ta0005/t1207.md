# Rogue Domain Controller

## Information

* Name: Rogue Domain Controller
* ID: T1207
* Tactics: [TA0005](./)

## Introduction

The Rogue Domain Controller technique (MITRE ATT\&CK ID: T1207) involves adversaries introducing unauthorized domain controllers into an Active Directory (AD) environment. Attackers leverage this rogue controller to intercept authentication requests, harvest credentials, manipulate group policies, and execute man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This technique allows attackers to gain persistent, privileged access and control over the targeted network infrastructure, often remaining undetected for extended periods.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Deploying a rogue domain controller typically involves several technical steps, mechanisms, and procedures:

* **Domain Controller Promotion:**
  * Attackers first gain administrative privileges within the target domain, allowing them to create and register new domain controllers.
  * Using tools like Microsoft's built-in `DCPromo` utility or PowerShell cmdlets (`Install-ADDSDomainController`), attackers promote compromised hosts or virtual machines to domain controllers.
* **DNS Manipulation:**
  * Attackers may modify DNS records or DHCP configurations to redirect authentication requests to the rogue domain controller.
  * DNS poisoning or DHCP spoofing techniques can ensure client systems authenticate through the rogue controller instead of legitimate ones.
* **Credential Harvesting and MITM Attacks:**
  * Once operational, the rogue controller intercepts and logs authentication requests, allowing attackers to capture credentials, hashes, or Kerberos tickets.
  * Attackers can leverage tools such as Mimikatz, Impacket, or Responder to extract credentials from intercepted traffic.
* **Group Policy Manipulation:**
  * Attackers can deploy malicious group policy objects (GPOs) from the rogue controller to execute arbitrary code, deploy malware, or maintain persistence across the domain.
  * Malicious GPOs may disable security mechanisms, deploy backdoors, or create new privileged user accounts.
* **Persistence and Concealment:**
  * Attackers often attempt to blend the rogue domain controller into the existing AD structure, naming it similarly to legitimate controllers or placing it in trusted organizational units (OUs).
  * Attackers may manipulate replication settings to prevent or limit synchronization with legitimate controllers, reducing visibility and detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically deploy rogue domain controllers during specific stages and scenarios of advanced persistent threats (APTs):

* **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation:**
  * After initial compromise and gaining administrative privileges, attackers deploy rogue controllers to escalate privileges further and facilitate lateral movement within the AD environment.
* **Credential Harvesting and Persistence:**
  * Attackers use rogue domain controllers to continuously harvest credentials, maintain persistent access, and re-establish control even if initial compromised hosts are remediated.
* **Man-in-the-Middle and Interception Attacks:**
  * Attackers deploy rogue controllers to intercept authentication traffic, enabling MITM attacks for credential theft, session hijacking, or injecting malicious payloads.
* **Long-Term Espionage and Data Exfiltration Campaigns:**
  * Sophisticated threat actors deploy rogue domain controllers in prolonged espionage campaigns to maintain persistent, undetected access to sensitive corporate data and intellectual property.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Effective detection of rogue domain controllers involves multiple approaches, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Monitoring Domain Controller Promotions:**
  * Continuously monitor event logs (e.g., Windows Event ID 29223) for unauthorized domain controller promotions.
  * Utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions (Splunk, QRadar, Elastic Security) to correlate events and generate alerts.
* **DNS and DHCP Anomaly Detection:**
  * Monitor DNS records for unexpected additions or modifications, especially new SRV records pointing to unknown domain controllers.
  * Detect DHCP anomalies or unauthorized DHCP servers appearing on the network.
* **Active Directory Replication Monitoring:**
  * Regularly audit AD replication topology for unauthorized or unexpected replication partners.
  * Leverage tools such as Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure ATP), BloodHound, or PingCastle to identify irregularities in AD replication and domain controller configurations.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Analyze network traffic for unusual authentication flows or Kerberos exchanges toward unknown IP addresses or hosts.
  * Use network monitoring tools (Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata) to detect anomalies in authentication traffic patterns.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unexpected domain controllers appearing in AD Sites and Services.
  * Unauthorized changes to DNS SRV records (`_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain>`).
  * Suspicious GPO modifications or new GPOs created unexpectedly.
  * Presence of credential-dumping tools (Mimikatz, Impacket) or evidence of their use in logs.
  * Rogue domain controllers identified by unusual hostnames, IP addresses, or locations within AD.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting rogue domain controllers early is crucial due to the severe impacts and risks they pose to organizational security:

* **Credential Theft and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Rogue controllers enable attackers to intercept and harvest credentials, leading to widespread privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network.
* **Long-Term Persistence and Access:**
  * Attackers can maintain persistent, hidden access to the organization's infrastructure, enabling prolonged espionage, data theft, and sabotage.
* **Compromise of Entire Active Directory Environment:**
  * Once attackers control a rogue domain controller, they can manipulate AD configurations, group policies, and replication, compromising the entire domain and all connected resources.
* **Operational Disruption and Downtime:**
  * Remediation of rogue domain controllers can be complex, costly, and disruptive, potentially requiring extensive downtime, forensic investigations, and rebuilding of AD infrastructure.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Risks:**
  * Failure to detect and remediate rogue controllers may result in severe compliance violations, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating the use of rogue domain controllers include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Campaign:**
  * Attackers leveraged rogue domain controllers to intercept authentication requests, harvest credentials, and maintain persistent access to targeted government and private sector networks.
  * Tools used: Mimikatz, custom PowerShell scripts, and native Windows utilities (`DCPromo`).
  * Impacts: Persistent espionage, credential theft, sensitive data exfiltration, and prolonged undetected access.
* **Operation Skeleton Key:**
  * Attackers deployed rogue domain controllers and modified AD authentication mechanisms to accept a universal "skeleton key" password, granting persistent administrative access across the domain.
  * Tools used: Mimikatz, custom malware payloads, and AD manipulation scripts.
  * Impacts: Persistent compromise of AD infrastructure, privileged access, and credential theft across multiple organizations.
* **FIN6 Cybercrime Group:**
  * In targeted attacks against financial institutions, FIN6 deployed rogue domain controllers to intercept credentials, manipulate group policies, and deploy ransomware payloads.
  * Tools used: PowerShell scripts, Impacket toolkit, Mimikatz, and ransomware payloads.
  * Impacts: Credential harvesting, widespread ransomware infections, operational disruption, and significant financial losses.
* **NotPetya Attack (2017):**
  * Although primarily a destructive malware attack, NotPetya leveraged compromised domain controllers and AD infrastructure to propagate rapidly across networks.
  * Attackers manipulated AD configurations and credentials harvested from compromised controllers to spread malicious payloads.
  * Tools used: Mimikatz, EternalBlue exploit, AD manipulation scripts.
  * Impacts: Massive operational disruption, billions of dollars in financial losses, and extensive infrastructure damage across multiple industries globally.

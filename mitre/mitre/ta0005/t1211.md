# Exploitation for Defense Evasion

## Information

* Name: Exploitation for Defense Evasion
* ID: T1211
* Tactics: [TA0005](./)

## Introduction

Exploitation for Defense Evasion (T1211) in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework refers to attackers leveraging vulnerabilities or security flaws within legitimate software or security mechanisms to bypass detection and evade defensive measures. By exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities, adversaries can disable, bypass, or manipulate security tools, policies, or monitoring capabilities, enabling persistent and covert access to compromised systems and networks.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employing exploitation for defense evasion typically follow these technical methodologies:

* **Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation:**
  * Attackers first identify vulnerabilities within security software, operating systems, or network infrastructure.
  * Vulnerabilities can be zero-day exploits or known issues that have not been patched.
  * Exploitation often involves crafted payloads or malicious code execution designed specifically to disable or circumvent security mechanisms.
* **Security Software Manipulation:**
  * Exploitation may target antivirus (AV), endpoint detection and response (EDR), intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), firewalls, and logging mechanisms.
  * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to disable or blind security tools, preventing alerts and detections.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
  * Exploits may grant elevated privileges, allowing attackers to disable security controls or modify configurations to evade detection.
  * Attackers frequently use exploits to establish persistence by modifying system components or security policies to remain undetected.
* **Bypassing Application Control:**
  * Exploiting vulnerabilities in application control solutions (such as whitelisting tools) allows attackers to execute unauthorized binaries or scripts.
  * Techniques such as DLL injection, process hollowing, and code injection are commonly observed.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically utilize exploitation for defense evasion during these attack scenarios and stages:

* **Initial Access Stage:**
  * Exploiting vulnerabilities in perimeter security devices (firewalls, VPNs) to bypass security checks and gain initial foothold.
* **Execution and Persistence Stages:**
  * Exploiting vulnerabilities in endpoint security solutions (AV, EDR) to execute malicious payloads without triggering alerts.
  * Disabling or bypassing endpoint protection software to establish persistent backdoors.
* **Lateral Movement Stage:**
  * Exploiting vulnerabilities in internal monitoring or logging solutions to move laterally undetected within the network.
* **Exfiltration and Command-and-Control (C2) Stages:**
  * Leveraging exploits to disable or bypass network monitoring tools and firewalls, facilitating stealthy data exfiltration and communication with external command-and-control servers.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods and tools commonly employed to identify exploitation for defense evasion include:

* **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**
  * Monitoring for unusual process behaviors, such as unexpected termination or disabling of security services.
  * Detecting unauthorized modifications to security software configurations or policies.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**
  * Real-time monitoring of endpoint activities to identify suspicious process injections, privilege escalations, or unauthorized security tool interactions.
* **Network Security Monitoring:**
  * Monitoring network traffic for abnormal patterns, including unexpected communications between compromised hosts and external IP addresses.
  * Identifying unusual protocol usage or encrypted traffic indicative of exploitation attempts.
* **Log Analysis and SIEM Correlation:**
  * Analyzing system and security logs to detect unexpected events, such as repeated crashes of security processes or unauthorized configuration changes.
  * Correlating events from multiple sources to identify exploitation attempts.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unexpected disabling or crashing of security services or processes.
  * Unusual registry or configuration changes related to security software.
  * Detection of known exploit signatures or payload artifacts.
  * Suspicious system calls or API usage indicative of code injection or privilege escalation.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early and effective detection of exploitation for defense evasion is critical due to the following impacts on systems and networks:

* **Loss of Visibility and Control:**
  * Exploitation can disable or bypass security tools, leaving defenders blind to ongoing malicious activities.
  * Attackers can operate undetected for extended periods, increasing the risk of data theft, sabotage, or espionage.
* **Increased Risk of Persistent Compromise:**
  * Exploits often enable attackers to establish persistent backdoors or footholds within critical systems.
  * Persistent access facilitates repeated attacks, lateral movement, and further exploitation.
* **Data Exfiltration and Intellectual Property Theft:**
  * Attackers leveraging defense evasion exploits can steal sensitive data without triggering security alerts.
  * Loss of intellectual property, customer data, or confidential business information can cause significant financial and reputational damage.
* **System Stability and Integrity Risks:**
  * Exploitation of vulnerabilities may result in system instability, crashes, or unintended behavior.
  * Critical infrastructure systems impacted by exploits pose severe operational and safety risks.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Consequences:**
  * Failure to detect and respond promptly to exploitation can result in regulatory fines or legal liabilities.
  * Organizations may face audits, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

## Examples

Real-world examples highlighting exploitation for defense evasion include:

* **NotPetya Ransomware Attack (2017):**
  * Attackers exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144) to bypass security mechanisms, propagate rapidly, and disable endpoint security tools.
  * Impact included widespread system outages, significant financial losses, and operational disruptions globally.
* **Operation WizardOpium (2019):**
  * Attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google's Chrome browser to bypass browser security mechanisms and deliver malware.
  * The exploit allowed attackers to evade detection and compromise targeted users, primarily for espionage purposes.
* **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020):**
  * Attackers exploited vulnerabilities within SolarWinds Orion software to bypass security monitoring and deliver malicious updates.
  * Attackers disabled or evaded endpoint detection solutions, leading to extensive compromise of governmental and enterprise networks.
* **Symantec Endpoint Protection Vulnerability Exploitation (CVE-2019-12758):**
  * Attackers exploited vulnerabilities within Symantec Endpoint Protection to disable or evade endpoint protection mechanisms.
  * Exploitation facilitated persistent malware infections and lateral movement within compromised organizations.
* **Cisco ASA/FTD Vulnerability Exploitation (CVE-2020-3452):**
  * Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices to bypass security policies and exfiltrate sensitive configuration data.
  * Successful exploitation allowed attackers to evade network security controls and gain unauthorized access to internal resources.

# AppDomainManager

## Information

* Name: AppDomainManager
* ID: T1574.014
* Tactics: [TA0003](../../ta0003/), [TA0004](../../ta0004/), [TA0005](../)
* Technique: [T1574](./)

## Introduction

The AppDomainManager (T1574.014) sub-technique is part of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the "Hijack Execution Flow" tactic. Adversaries leverage the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) feature known as AppDomainManager to execute malicious code. AppDomainManager allows attackers to intercept, modify, or control the behavior of .NET applications by injecting malicious assemblies, thus enabling persistent and stealthy execution of malicious payloads while evading traditional detection methods.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

AppDomainManager is a feature provided by the .NET Framework that enables applications to customize the behavior of application domains, which are isolated environments used to execute managed code. By specifying a custom AppDomainManager, attackers can intercept and influence the application's execution flow, effectively embedding malicious code into legitimate processes.

Technical details include:

* **CLR Execution Flow Hijacking**:
  * Attackers modify registry keys or configuration files to point to a malicious AppDomainManager assembly.
  * When any .NET application runs, the CLR loads this malicious assembly automatically, executing attacker-controlled code.
* **Registry Manipulation**:
  * Attackers commonly modify registry keys such as:
    * `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AppDomainManagerAssembly`
    * `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AppDomainManagerType`
  * These keys specify the assembly and type of AppDomainManager to load.
* **Assembly Injection**:
  * Malicious assemblies (DLL files) placed in strategic locations (e.g., Global Assembly Cache (GAC), application directories) are loaded automatically by the CLR.
  * Attackers may use strong-name signing or bypass signing requirements to ensure assemblies load without raising suspicion.
* **Persistence and Stealth**:
  * Modifying AppDomainManager settings provides persistent execution across system reboots.
  * Malicious code execution occurs within legitimate processes, making detection challenging.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ AppDomainManager sub-technique during the following scenarios or stages:

* **Persistence Stage**:
  * To maintain long-term access to compromised systems through persistent execution of malicious assemblies.
* **Defense Evasion Stage**:
  * To evade detection by embedding malicious code within legitimate .NET processes, making malicious activity appear as normal application behavior.
* **Privilege Escalation and Execution**:
  * Attackers can leverage AppDomainManager to execute code in the context of legitimate processes, potentially inheriting elevated privileges.
* **Targeted Attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**:
  * Commonly used by sophisticated attackers targeting enterprises, government organizations, or critical infrastructure.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting malicious use of AppDomainManager involves monitoring and analyzing specific indicators and behaviors:

* **Registry Monitoring**:
  * Monitor registry keys for unexpected modifications:
    * `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AppDomainManagerAssembly`
    * `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AppDomainManagerType`
  * Alert on unauthorized or suspicious changes to these keys.
* **File System Analysis**:
  * Monitor unusual DLL placements or assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) or application directories.
  * Identify unsigned or suspiciously signed assemblies loaded by .NET processes.
* **Process Monitoring and Behavioral Analysis**:
  * Monitor .NET application processes for unusual behaviors, unexpected DLL loads, or suspicious network connections.
  * Employ tools such as Sysmon, Process Monitor, or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to track process activity.
* **Event Log Analysis**:
  * Analyze Windows Event Logs for CLR-related events or unusual application crashes indicating failed malicious assembly loads.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Suspicious DLL files or assemblies in system directories or GAC.
  * Unexpected registry entries pointing to unknown assemblies or types.
  * Unusual outbound network connections initiated by .NET processes.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of AppDomainManager abuse is crucial due to its potential impacts on system and network security:

* **Stealth and Persistence**:
  * Attackers can persistently execute malicious code within legitimate processes, significantly complicating detection and remediation efforts.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:
  * Malicious assemblies executed through AppDomainManager may inherit privileges of host processes, allowing attackers to escalate privileges or move laterally within networks.
* **Data Exfiltration and Espionage**:
  * Attackers can leverage embedded malicious assemblies to exfiltrate sensitive data, execute espionage activities, or establish command-and-control (C2) channels.
* **Evasion of Traditional Security Measures**:
  * Traditional antivirus or endpoint security solutions may not easily detect malicious code executed through legitimate .NET processes, highlighting the importance of specialized monitoring and detection strategies.

Detecting and responding to AppDomainManager abuse early can minimize damage, prevent persistent footholds, and reduce the risk of significant data loss or compromise.

## Examples

Real-world examples of AppDomainManager abuses include:

* **FIN7 Group Attacks**:
  * The FIN7 cybercriminal group has leveraged AppDomainManager to execute malicious payloads persistently, embedding malicious assemblies into legitimate .NET applications to evade detection.
* **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  * The Russian-based APT29 has been observed using AppDomainManager techniques to maintain persistent access within compromised networks, executing stealthy payloads through legitimate Windows processes.
* **Tools and Malware Leveraging AppDomainManager**:
  * Custom-developed malware or implants designed specifically to exploit AppDomainManager functionality by modifying registry keys, injecting malicious assemblies, and executing payloads within trusted processes.
* **Attack Scenario Example**:
  1. Attacker gains initial access to a target system through phishing or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  2. Attacker modifies registry keys (`AppDomainManagerAssembly`, `AppDomainManagerType`) to point to a malicious assembly.
  3. Malicious DLL assembly placed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) or application directory.
  4. Legitimate .NET processes execute the malicious assembly automatically upon startup or execution.
  5. Malicious payload establishes persistent backdoor access, enabling further exploitation, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.

These examples demonstrate the significant risks associated with the AppDomainManager sub-technique and emphasize the importance of proactive monitoring, detection, and response strategies.

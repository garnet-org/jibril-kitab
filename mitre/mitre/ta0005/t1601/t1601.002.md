# Downgrade System Image

## Information

* Name: Downgrade System Image
* ID: T1601.002
* Tactics: [TA0005](../)
* Technique: [T1601](./)

## Introduction

Downgrade System Image (T1601.002) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under the "Modify System Image" technique (T1601). This sub-technique involves attackers intentionally downgrading the firmware or operating system image on network devices or endpoints to older, potentially vulnerable versions. By reverting systems to earlier software releases, adversaries aim to exploit known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions, thereby facilitating unauthorized access, persistence, or lateral movement within compromised environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers implementing the Downgrade System Image sub-technique typically leverage administrative-level access or exploit weak authentication mechanisms to replace current firmware or operating system images with older versions. Key technical aspects include:

* **Firmware/OS Downgrade**: Attackers replace the existing system firmware or OS with an older version containing known vulnerabilities. This can involve:
  * Exploiting device management interfaces, such as web-based admin consoles or SSH/Telnet access.
  * Using legitimate device management tools or vendor-provided utilities to initiate firmware rollbacks.
  * Manipulating device boot sequences to load older firmware images stored locally or remotely.
* **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities**: Older firmware or software versions typically contain documented vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to:
  * Gain unauthorized administrative access.
  * Execute remote code execution (RCE) exploits.
  * Establish persistent backdoors or command-and-control (C2) channels.
* **Persistence and Stealth**: Downgrading firmware or OS images can help attackers:
  * Evade security controls and detection mechanisms present in newer software versions.
  * Maintain persistent access through known, reliable vulnerabilities.
  * Blend malicious activity with legitimate downgrade operations, complicating detection efforts.
* **Targeted Devices and Systems**:
  * Network infrastructure devices (routers, switches, firewalls).
  * IoT devices and embedded systems.
  * Servers and endpoint systems capable of firmware/OS rollback.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically utilize the Downgrade System Image sub-technique during various attack stages and scenarios, including:

* **Initial Access and Exploitation**:
  * Early stages of intrusion to exploit known vulnerabilities present in outdated firmware or OS versions.
  * Circumventing security patches and updates applied by defenders.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**:
  * Maintaining persistent access by reverting systems to vulnerable states.
  * Escalating privileges through vulnerabilities patched in newer system images.
* **Defense Evasion**:
  * Downgrading firmware or OS images to evade detection by security monitoring tools or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions optimized for newer software versions.
  * Avoiding security controls and mitigations introduced in recent firmware or software updates.
* **Lateral Movement and Reconnaissance**:
  * Downgrading network infrastructure devices to gain lateral access across network segments.
  * Facilitating reconnaissance and data exfiltration through vulnerabilities present in older firmware images.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of the Downgrade System Image sub-technique involves monitoring for anomalous firmware or software version changes, unauthorized downgrade requests, and suspicious device behaviors. Effective detection strategies and indicators include:

* **Firmware and OS Version Monitoring**:
  * Regularly auditing firmware and OS versions across network devices and endpoints.
  * Detecting unexpected rollbacks or downgrades to older firmware images.
* **Device Configuration and Audit Logs**:
  * Reviewing device management logs for unauthorized firmware downgrade commands or operations.
  * Alerting on unusual administrative activities or commands issued outside of scheduled maintenance windows.
* **Network Traffic Analysis**:
  * Identifying unusual network connections or file transfers associated with firmware image downloads or updates.
  * Monitoring for outbound or inbound connections to unauthorized firmware repositories or sources.
* **Integrity Checks and Hash Validation**:
  * Periodically validating firmware images through cryptographic hash comparisons against known legitimate versions.
  * Detecting manipulated or unauthorized firmware images through hash discrepancies.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and SIEM Solutions**:
  * Leveraging endpoint monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes in system images.
  * Utilizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to aggregate and analyze logs for suspicious downgrade activities.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

* Unexpected firmware or OS version regressions.
* Unauthorized administrative sessions initiating downgrade commands.
* Unusual network activity related to firmware image downloads from unknown sources.
* Hash mismatches or integrity failures detected during firmware validation checks.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of the Downgrade System Image sub-technique is crucial due to significant potential impacts on organizational security, operational reliability, and data integrity. Key reasons to prioritize detection include:

* **Exposure to Known Vulnerabilities**:
  * Downgrading system images reintroduces previously patched vulnerabilities, significantly increasing the risk of exploitation.
  * Attackers can rapidly leverage documented exploits to compromise critical systems.
* **Persistence and Long-Term Compromise**:
  * Attackers often use firmware downgrades to establish persistent footholds within networks, complicating remediation efforts.
  * Persistent access can facilitate ongoing data exfiltration, espionage, or sabotage activities.
* **Reduced Effectiveness of Security Controls**:
  * Older firmware or OS versions may lack built-in security controls and mitigations introduced in newer releases, reducing overall security posture.
  * Downgraded systems may evade detection by security tools optimized for current software versions.
* **Operational Disruption and System Reliability**:
  * Unauthorized firmware downgrades can introduce stability issues, performance degradation, or incompatibility with existing infrastructure.
  * Operational disruptions resulting from compromised or unstable systems can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Implications**:
  * Organizations subject to regulatory compliance requirements may face penalties or sanctions due to inadequate security controls or failure to maintain secure firmware/software versions.
  * Early detection and response help mitigate compliance-related risks and liabilities.

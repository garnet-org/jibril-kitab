# Rootkit

## Information

* Name: Rootkit
* ID: T1014
* Tactics: [TA0005](./)

## Introduction

Rootkits are malicious software or collections of software tools designed to gain unauthorized root-level or administrative access to a computer system, maintain persistent control, and conceal their presence from detection. In the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, rootkits fall under the "Defense Evasion" tactic (T1014), as attackers utilize them primarily to hide their activities, maintain persistence, and evade detection by security tools and administrators.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Rootkits operate by modifying or intercepting the normal flow of operating system processes, APIs, or kernel functions. They typically achieve stealth and persistence through several technical methods:

* **Kernel-Level Rootkits:**
  * Run with kernel-level privileges, allowing complete control over system functions.
  * Modify kernel objects, structures, or functions to hide processes, files, network connections, and registry entries.
  * Often implemented as loadable kernel modules (LKMs) or device drivers.
* **User-Level Rootkits:**
  * Execute in user-mode, typically manipulating binaries, libraries (DLL injection), or system utilities.
  * Hook system calls or APIs to filter information returned to monitoring tools and antivirus software.
* **Bootkits:**
  * Infect the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), or boot loader.
  * Execute before the operating system loads, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove.
* **Firmware/Hardware Rootkits:**
  * Embedded within hardware firmware (BIOS, UEFI, network cards, storage controllers).
  * Persist even after complete system reinstallation or hard disk replacement.

Common mechanisms utilized by rootkits include:

* **API Hooking and System Call Interception:**
  * Redirect legitimate function calls to malicious code, hiding attacker processes or activities.
* **Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM):**
  * Alter kernel structures directly, bypassing normal API calls and making detection challenging.
* **Process and File Hiding:**
  * Alter directory listings, process enumeration, and network connection tables to conceal attacker presence.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
  * Ensure continued control over compromised systems through hidden backdoors and elevated privileges.

Real-world attackers frequently use rootkits in conjunction with other malware types, such as Trojans, RATs (Remote Access Trojans), and ransomware, to enhance stealth and prolong their presence within compromised environments.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Rootkits appear in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Compromise:**
  * Rarely deployed directly at initial entry; typically follow initial infection via phishing, exploit kits, or software vulnerabilities.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers deploy rootkits after gaining initial foothold to escalate privileges and maintain persistent administrative access.
* **Defense Evasion and Persistence:**
  * Rootkits are primarily used to avoid detection by antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and manual forensic analysis.
  * Commonly used during advanced persistent threat (APT) operations to maintain long-term stealthy access.
* **Data Exfiltration and Espionage:**
  * Attackers leverage rootkit capabilities to conceal data exfiltration activities and remain undetected while stealing sensitive information.
* **Sabotage and Disruption:**
  * In rare cases, rootkits are used to disrupt critical infrastructure or conceal destructive attacks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Rootkit detection requires specialized methods and tools due to their stealthy nature:

* **Behavioral Analysis:**
  * Monitor abnormal system behavior, such as unexpected system crashes, performance degradation, or unusual network traffic patterns.
* **Integrity Checking:**
  * Use file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized changes to critical system files, kernel modules, or boot records.
* **Memory Forensics:**
  * Employ memory analysis tools (e.g., Volatility Framework, Rekall) to detect hidden processes, kernel hooks, and suspicious memory allocations.
* **Kernel-Level Monitoring:**
  * Utilize kernel-level monitoring solutions and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect anomalies in kernel structures and API hooking.
* **Signature-Based Detection:**
  * Antivirus and antimalware solutions with updated signatures can detect known rootkit variants.
* **Boot-Level and Firmware Scanning:**
  * Specialized security tools (e.g., CHIPSEC, RootkitRevealer) scan boot sectors, firmware, and hardware components for hidden rootkits.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with rootkits include:

* Hidden or suspicious kernel modules or device drivers
* Unusual hooks or modifications in kernel APIs or system calls
* Unexpected modifications to boot records or firmware
* Presence of hidden files, directories, or registry entries
* Suspicious network connections or unexplained outbound traffic

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of rootkits is crucial due to their severe impacts on systems and networks, including:

* **Long-term Persistence:**
  * Rootkits enable attackers to maintain persistent, stealthy access, potentially for months or years, without detection.
* **Data Theft and Espionage:**
  * Attackers use rootkits to conceal data exfiltration, leading to significant intellectual property loss, financial damage, or sensitive information exposure.
* **System Integrity Compromise:**
  * Rootkits compromise the integrity of operating systems and critical applications, potentially causing instability, crashes, or data corruption.
* **Increased Difficulty in Remediation:**
  * Rootkits embedded at kernel or firmware levels are notoriously difficult to remove, often requiring extensive remediation efforts or complete system rebuilds.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Impact:**
  * Failure to detect and address rootkits can lead to regulatory penalties, compliance violations, and severe reputational damage.
* **Potential for Escalated Attacks:**
  * Undetected rootkits can serve as footholds for attackers to launch further attacks, lateral movement, or destructive activities within the network.

## Examples

Real-world examples of rootkit usage include:

* **Sony BMG Rootkit Scandal (2005):**
  * Sony Music CDs installed hidden DRM rootkits on users' computers, concealing processes and files.
  * Impact: Significant public backlash, legal actions, and reputational damage to Sony.
* **Necurs Rootkit:**
  * Kernel-level rootkit used by cybercriminals to hide botnet activity, spam distribution, and malware payloads.
  * Impact: Enabled large-scale spam campaigns, ransomware distribution, and credential theft.
* **Turla (Snake/Uroburos) Rootkit:**
  * Sophisticated APT group-associated rootkit used for espionage activities, kernel-level hooking, and stealthy persistence.
  * Impact: Targeted government agencies and defense contractors, resulting in sensitive data theft and espionage.
* **LoJax UEFI Rootkit:**
  * First publicly known UEFI rootkit used by APT28 (Fancy Bear) to maintain persistence on targeted systems.
  * Impact: Persistent infection surviving OS reinstallation, enabling long-term espionage and data exfiltration.
* **ZeroAccess Rootkit:**
  * User-mode and kernel-mode rootkit used to conceal click fraud, bitcoin mining, and botnet activities.
  * Impact: Millions of infected systems, significant financial losses, and resource abuse.

Attackers commonly use rootkit tools such as:

* Hacker Defender
* Vanquish
* FU Rootkit
* Azazel
* Reptile
* Alureon/TDL4 Rootkit

These real-world examples demonstrate rootkits' significant threat, emphasizing the critical importance of detection, prevention, and rapid response.

## Information

* Name: Port Knocking
* ID: T1205.001
* Tactics: [TA0005](../), [TA0003](../../ta0003/), [TA0011](../../ta0011/)
* Technique: [T1205](./)

## Introduction

Port Knocking (T1205.001) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the parent technique "Traffic Signaling (T1205)." It involves a stealthy approach where attackers send connection attempts to a predefined sequence of closed ports on a targeted host. This sequence acts as a secret handshake, triggering the targeted system to open a specific port or execute certain actions, allowing attackers covert access. Port knocking is commonly employed to evade detection by security monitoring tools and firewalls, as it disguises malicious activity as benign network traffic.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Port knocking is a covert communication technique that leverages sequences of connection attempts to closed ports. The target system monitors incoming connection attempts and waits for a predefined sequence to trigger predefined actions, such as opening ports or executing commands.

Technical details and execution mechanisms include:

* **Sequence Definition:**\
  Attackers predetermine a specific sequence of ports that must be "knocked" in a particular order. The sequence can vary in complexity, involving multiple ports and timing intervals.
* **Trigger Mechanism:**\
  The target system listens passively, typically using specialized software or scripts, for the correct sequence of connection attempts. Once the correct sequence is detected, the system executes predefined actions, such as opening a hidden service port or initiating a reverse shell.
* **Network Protocols and Methods:**\
  Port knocking typically uses TCP or UDP connection attempts. Attackers may use simple tools like netcat, hping, or custom scripts to perform knocking sequences.
* **Stealth and Evasion:**\
  Because port knocking involves connection attempts to closed ports, these attempts often appear as harmless background noise or scanning activities, allowing attackers to remain undetected by traditional security measures.
* **Variations and Enhancements:**\
  Attackers may employ advanced variations, including:
  * Single Packet Authorization (SPA), where encrypted packets containing authentication details trigger actions.
  * Time-based knocking sequences, where timing intervals between knocks are critical for successful activation.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Port knocking is typically employed in scenarios requiring stealthy, covert access and persistence. Common attack scenarios and stages include:

* **Initial Access:**\
  Attackers may use port knocking to gain initial entry into secured environments, bypassing perimeter firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS).
* **Persistence and Backdoor Maintenance:**\
  Once initial access is established, attackers often employ port knocking as a covert method to maintain persistent, hidden access channels.
* **Command and Control (C2) Communications:**\
  Attackers may use port knocking sequences as covert signaling methods to trigger command execution or data exfiltration without raising alarms.
* **Evading Network Monitoring and IDS:**\
  Port knocking allows attackers to evade detection mechanisms that rely on identifying open ports or suspicious traffic patterns, as knocking sequences blend into normal network noise.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of port knocking can be challenging due to its stealthy nature. However, several methods and tools can enhance detection capabilities:

* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Monitor and analyze firewall logs, IDS logs, and network traffic captures for unusual connection attempts to multiple closed ports from the same source IP address within short time intervals.
  * Identify patterns of sequential port scans or connection attempts, especially those repeated regularly or from suspicious external IP addresses.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and SIEM:**
  * Configure IDS systems (such as Snort, Suricata, or Zeek) with custom rules to detect repeated connection attempts to closed ports.
  * Integrate logs into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms to correlate and detect anomalous behavior indicative of port knocking.
* **Endpoint Monitoring:**
  * Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for suspicious processes or scripts that may be listening for knocking sequences.
  * Look for unauthorized modifications to firewall rules or network configurations that could indicate hidden port knocking setups.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Repeated, timed connection attempts to closed ports from single IP addresses.
  * Unusual firewall rule changes or temporary port openings triggered by specific connection sequences.
  * Presence of suspicious scripts or binaries on endpoints designed to monitor and respond to knocking sequences.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting port knocking is critical due to its potential impacts on network security and system integrity:

* **Hidden Backdoor Access:**\
  Port knocking allows attackers to maintain covert, persistent backdoor access, bypassing standard security controls and firewall protections.
* **Stealthy Data Exfiltration:**\
  Attackers may use port knocking to trigger covert channels for data exfiltration, potentially resulting in significant data breaches without detection.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:**\
  Once attackers gain hidden access through port knocking, they may escalate privileges, move laterally within networks, and compromise additional systems.
* **Difficulty in Detection and Remediation:**\
  Due to its stealthy nature, port knocking can evade traditional security monitoring, allowing attackers to remain undetected for extended periods, increasing the damage potential.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Risks:**\
  Undetected covert access channels can lead to compliance violations, regulatory fines, and reputational damage to organizations.

Early detection and response to port knocking activities significantly reduce risks, limit attacker footholds, and minimize potential damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples and scenarios involving port knocking include:

* **Custom Malware and Backdoors:**\
  Attackers have developed custom malware that implements port knocking sequences to open hidden ports or establish reverse shells. For example, malware such as advanced Linux rootkits or embedded device backdoors have leveraged port knocking to evade detection.
* **Single Packet Authorization (SPA):**\
  Tools like "Fwknop" (Firewall Knock Operator) use encrypted packets to perform single packet authorization, a sophisticated evolution of traditional port knocking. Attackers can misuse similar methods to trigger hidden access.
* **Penetration Testing Tools:**\
  Security professionals and attackers alike use tools such as "knockd," "knockpy," and custom scripts to implement port knocking techniques. Misuse of these tools by attackers is documented in penetration testing reports and incident analyses.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups:**\
  Certain APT groups have been reported using port knocking techniques to maintain hidden access to compromised networks, reducing the likelihood of detection by network monitoring and defensive controls.

Specific case scenarios might include:

* An attacker scans a network perimeter, identifies a system configured with port knocking, and sends a predefined sequence of connection attempts to closed ports. The system then opens an SSH port temporarily, allowing covert access.
* Attackers implant malware on compromised hosts that listens passively for knocking sequences. Upon receiving the correct sequence, the malware initiates a reverse shell to a remote attacker-controlled server, bypassing firewall rules and network monitoring.

Understanding these examples helps organizations recognize potential threats, improve detection mechanisms, and enhance defensive strategies against port knocking attacks.

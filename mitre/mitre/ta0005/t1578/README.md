# Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure

## Information

* Name: Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure
* ID: T1578
* Tactics: [TA0005](../)
* Sub-Technique: T1578.004, T1578.003, T1578.005, [T1578.002](t1578.002.md), [T1578.001](t1578.001.md)

## Introduction

"Modify Cloud Environment" (T1578) is a technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, categorized under the "Impact" tactic. This technique involves adversaries altering cloud environments, including configuration settings, permissions, or resources, to achieve their malicious objectives. Attackers may modify cloud infrastructure to disrupt services, escalate privileges, evade detection, or maintain persistence within compromised environments. Understanding this technique is critical, as cloud environments increasingly host sensitive data and critical business operations.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employing the Modify Cloud Environment technique may execute various methods and mechanisms to achieve their objectives:

### Execution Methods and Mechanisms

* **Modification of Cloud Resources:**
  * Altering configurations or security settings of virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.
  * Changing storage bucket permissions, access controls, or encryption settings.
  * Adjusting network configurations such as firewall rules, security groups, or virtual private cloud (VPC) settings.
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Manipulation:**
  * Modifying IAM policies to grant unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
  * Changing roles or permissions to enable persistent access to cloud resources.
* **Logging and Monitoring Interference:**
  * Disabling or modifying cloud logging services to avoid detection.
  * Tampering with audit trails or monitoring configurations to conceal malicious activities.
* **Resource Scaling and Cost Manipulation:**
  * Increasing resource usage or provisioning unnecessary resources to inflate cloud service costs intentionally.
  * Reducing resource availability to cause denial of service or disrupt legitimate operations.

### Real-world Procedures

* Attackers may exploit compromised cloud administrator accounts or API keys to modify resources.
* Automated scripts or cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure PowerShell, Google Cloud SDK) may be used to rapidly alter cloud configurations.
* Attackers may leverage misconfigured cloud environments or exposed APIs to modify resources without initial compromise.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This technique can appear in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Access and Persistence:**
  * Attackers alter cloud IAM policies or access controls to maintain persistent access even if initial compromise vectors are remediated.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Modification of IAM roles and permissions to escalate privileges and gain greater control or access to sensitive data.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Disabling or altering logging and monitoring configurations to evade detection and response efforts.
* **Impact and Disruption:**
  * Modifying critical cloud resources or infrastructure to disrupt business operations, causing downtime or denial of service.
  * Manipulating resource allocations to inflate cloud costs, causing financial harm.
* **Exfiltration and Data Theft:**
  * Changing storage bucket permissions or encryption settings to facilitate data exfiltration.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of cloud environment modifications involves several methods, tools, and indicators:

### Detection Methods

* **Cloud Audit Logs and Monitoring:**
  * Regularly monitoring cloud provider audit logs (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, Google Cloud Audit Logs) for unauthorized or unusual configuration changes.
  * Implementing automated alerts for changes to critical resources, IAM policies, and security configurations.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Solutions:**
  * Integrating cloud logs into SIEM platforms to correlate events and detect suspicious patterns or anomalies.
  * Utilizing predefined detection rules and behavioral analytics to identify unusual modification activities.
* **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Tools:**
  * Continuously assessing the cloud environment for misconfigurations or unauthorized changes.
  * Detecting deviations from established security baselines or compliance standards.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* Unexpected changes to IAM roles, permissions, or policies.
* Unauthorized disabling or modification of logging and monitoring services.
* Sudden increase in resource provisioning or changes in resource configurations.
* Suspicious API calls or actions from unknown or unusual IP addresses.
* Alterations to encryption settings, bucket permissions, or network security rules without documented authorization.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of modifications to cloud environments is crucial due to the significant potential impacts on organizations:

* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Unauthorized changes can cause service outages, downtime, or degraded performance, impacting business continuity and customer trust.
* **Data Breach and Leakage:**
  * Attackers modifying permissions or encryption settings may facilitate unauthorized data access, exfiltration, or leakage of sensitive information.
* **Financial Impact:**
  * Manipulation of cloud resources can lead to unexpected increases in cloud service costs, causing financial damage and resource wastage.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Consequences:**
  * Unauthorized modifications may violate compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS), resulting in legal penalties, fines, or reputational damage.
* **Security Posture Weakening:**
  * Modifications to security controls, logging, or monitoring may reduce visibility and hinder incident response efforts, prolonging attacker dwell time and amplifying potential damage.

Detecting this technique early allows organizations to prevent or mitigate these impacts, respond promptly to threats, and maintain the integrity and availability of critical cloud resources.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating attack scenarios, tools used, and resulting impacts include:

* **Capital One Data Breach (2019):**
  * **Attack Scenario:** Attacker exploited a misconfigured AWS IAM role and firewall setting to access sensitive customer data stored in AWS S3 buckets.
  * **Tools Used:** AWS CLI, custom scripts.
  * **Impact:** Exfiltration of personal data of over 100 million customers, resulting in significant regulatory fines, reputational harm, and substantial financial losses.
* **Tesla Cloud Infrastructure Breach (2018):**
  * **Attack Scenario:** Attackers infiltrated Tesla's AWS infrastructure through unsecured Kubernetes consoles, modifying resources to mine cryptocurrency.
  * **Tools Used:** Kubernetes API, crypto-mining software, AWS resource manipulation scripts.
  * **Impact:** Unauthorized resource usage, increased cloud costs, potential exposure of proprietary data, and reputational damage.
* **Code Spaces Incident (2014):**
  * **Attack Scenario:** Attackers gained access to AWS management console, modified IAM policies, and deleted critical resources and backups.
  * **Tools Used:** AWS management console, API calls.
  * **Impact:** Permanent loss of company data, forced shutdown of business operations, and eventual closure of the company.
* **TeamTNT Cloud Attacks (2020-2021):**
  * **Attack Scenario:** Attackers scanned for exposed Docker APIs and Kubernetes clusters, modified cloud resources, and deployed cryptocurrency miners.
  * **Tools Used:** Docker APIs, Kubernetes APIs, crypto-mining malware, automated cloud modification scripts.
  * **Impact:** Unauthorized resource usage, inflated cloud costs, system degradation, and compromised infrastructure integrity.

These examples highlight the severity and variety of impacts associated with the Modify Cloud Environment technique, emphasizing the importance of robust detection, monitoring, and response strategies.

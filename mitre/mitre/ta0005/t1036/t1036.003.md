# Rename System Utilities

## Information

* Name: Rename System Utilities
* ID: T1036.003
* Tactics: [TA0005](../)
* Technique: [T1036](./)

## Introduction

Rename System Utilities ([T1036.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003/)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader technique of "Masquerading." Attackers rename legitimate system utilities or common administrative tools to evade detection by security software, analysts, or endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems. By changing the name of trusted executables, adversaries attempt to conceal malicious activities and blend into the normal operational environment.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employ this sub-technique by renaming legitimate system utilities or administrative tools commonly available in operating systems, such as Windows or Linux. These utilities typically include:

* Windows utilities:
  * `cmd.exe`
  * `powershell.exe`
  * `tasklist.exe`
  * `svchost.exe`
  * `regsvr32.exe`
  * `rundll32.exe`
  * `net.exe`
* Linux utilities:
  * `bash`
  * `sh`
  * `wget`
  * `curl`
  * `python`
  * `perl`

Attackers may rename these executables to innocuous-sounding or misleading names that appear legitimate, such as:

* Renaming `powershell.exe` to `explorer.exe` or `svchost32.exe` to blend in with system processes.
* Using random character strings or names that mimic common applications (`chrome.exe`, `firefox.exe`, `update.exe`).
* Renaming utilities to obscure file extensions or omitting them entirely to confuse endpoint detection systems.

Technical mechanisms attackers use include:

* Directly renaming binaries after copying them to another directory.
* Using scripting languages (`PowerShell`, `batch scripts`, `bash scripts`) to automate renaming and execution.
* Leveraging legitimate administrative tools or scripts to rename and execute binaries silently.

Real-world procedures often involve attackers renaming binaries immediately after initial compromise to maintain persistence and evade endpoint detection tools that rely on known file names or process monitoring.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique is used in various stages of a cyberattack lifecycle, specifically:

* **Initial Access and Execution**:
  * Attackers rename utilities immediately after exploitation to disguise their activities from initial detection mechanisms.
  * Renamed binaries may be executed through phishing payloads, malicious macros, or exploit kits.
* **Defense Evasion**:
  * Primarily used to evade endpoint security solutions, antivirus software, and behavioral analysis tools.
  * Helps attackers bypass detection rules that rely on known binary names or paths.
* **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**:
  * Renamed system utilities are often placed in startup folders or scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
  * Attackers leverage renamed binaries to escalate privileges or execute commands without raising suspicion.
* **Lateral Movement and Command-and-Control (C2)**:
  * Renamed utilities may be used to facilitate lateral movement by executing remote commands or scripts.
  * Attackers may use renamed binaries to establish or maintain covert communication channels with external C2 servers.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods for renamed system utilities involve several strategies and tools:

* **Endpoint Monitoring and Behavioral Analysis**:
  * Monitor process execution anomalies, such as common system utilities executing from unusual directories or with uncommon filenames.
  * Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools can detect anomalous process hierarchies (e.g., `explorer.exe` spawning `cmd.exe` or renamed binaries).
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:
  * Implement FIM solutions to detect unauthorized changes or renaming of system binaries.
  * Alert on new or modified executables appearing in unusual system directories or user directories.
* **Process Hashing and Signature Analysis**:
  * Maintain a baseline of legitimate binaries through hashes and signatures, and alert when known binaries appear with different filenames.
  * Use tools such as Sysmon, OSQuery, or commercial EDR solutions to detect renamed binaries through hash comparisons.
* **Logging and Auditing**:
  * Enable detailed process creation and file system auditing logs to detect and investigate suspicious file renaming or execution events.
  * Centralized logging (SIEM) solutions can correlate events to identify anomalies.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

* Known system binaries executing from non-standard directories or with unusual filenames.
* Suspicious process hierarchies or parent-child relationships (e.g., `explorer.exe` spawning renamed utilities).
* Unexpected executable files appearing in temporary directories, user profiles, or hidden folders.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of renamed system utilities is crucial due to the following potential impacts:

* **Evasion of Security Controls**:
  * Renaming trusted binaries can bypass traditional antivirus solutions, endpoint monitoring tools, and behavioral detection systems, increasing the risk of prolonged undetected intrusions.
* **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**:
  * Attackers frequently leverage renamed utilities to establish persistent footholds in compromised systems, making remediation more complex and time-consuming.
* **Data Exfiltration and Espionage**:
  * Renamed utilities facilitate covert command execution, data exfiltration, and communication with external Command-and-Control servers, leading to significant data breaches or intellectual property theft.
* **Operational Impact and Resource Consumption**:
  * Undetected malicious activities utilizing renamed system utilities can degrade system performance, consume network resources, or disrupt critical business operations.

Early detection enables rapid response, containment, and remediation, significantly reducing the potential damage and operational impact.

## Examples

Real-world examples include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  * Known to rename legitimate Windows utilities such as `rundll32.exe` to innocuous names like `svchost.exe` or `explorer.exe` to evade detection during targeted espionage campaigns.
  * Used renamed binaries to execute malicious DLLs and scripts covertly, enabling persistent access and data exfiltration.
* **FIN7 Cybercrime Group**:
  * Renamed PowerShell executables to misleading filenames such as `GoogleUpdate.exe` or `AdobeUpdater.exe` to hide malicious scripts used for lateral movement and data theft.
  * Leveraged renamed utilities to evade endpoint detection tools and maintain long-term persistence within compromised networks.
* **TrickBot Malware**:
  * Frequently renames legitimate Windows binaries or creates similarly named executables (`svchost32.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`) to conceal malicious payload execution.
  * Used these renamed binaries to perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and credential harvesting operations.
* **Emotet Malware**:
  * Utilized renamed system utilities, such as `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`, disguised as legitimate software updates or installers to execute malicious payloads and evade antivirus detection.
  * Renamed binaries allowed Emotet to maintain persistence and facilitate secondary infections, including ransomware deployment.

These examples highlight the widespread use of this technique by sophisticated threat actors, emphasizing the importance of robust detection and monitoring capabilities.

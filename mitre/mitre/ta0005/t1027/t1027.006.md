# HTML Smuggling

## Information

* Name: HTML Smuggling
* ID: T1027.006
* Tactics: [TA0005](../)
* Technique: [T1027](./)

## Introduction

HTML Smuggling (T1027.006) is a sub-technique categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework technique "Obfuscated Files or Information" (T1027). This technique involves attackers leveraging legitimate HTML5 and JavaScript features to obfuscate and deliver malicious payloads directly into victim endpoints. By embedding encoded or encrypted files within HTML documents, attackers bypass traditional gateway security controls, such as email filters, web proxies, and antivirus solutions, enabling malicious payloads to reach endpoint devices undetected.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

HTML Smuggling exploits legitimate browser features, primarily HTML5 and JavaScript, to encode, embed, and decode malicious payloads directly within HTML documents. Rather than downloading malicious files directly from external sources, attackers use JavaScript code embedded in HTML documents to dynamically generate and deliver malicious files to the victim's system. This technique effectively bypasses network-based security controls, as payloads are not directly transmitted over the network as recognizable files.

Technical execution methods include:

* **JavaScript Blob Objects**: Attackers use JavaScript Blob objects to store binary data in memory, dynamically generating malicious files on the victim's browser.
* **HTML5 download attribute**: Attackers leverage the HTML5 anchor tag (`<a>`) with the `download` attribute to prompt victims to download malicious files directly from the browser-generated content.
* **Encoding and Obfuscation**: Payloads can be encoded in Base64 or other encoding schemes, further complicating detection and analysis.
* **Data URLs**: Malicious payloads embedded directly within HTML using data URLs (`data:text/html;base64,...`) to bypass network detection.

Real-world procedures typically involve:

1. Attacker crafts a malicious HTML document containing embedded JavaScript.
2. The victim receives this document via email attachments, malicious websites, or messaging platforms.
3. Victim opens the HTML file in a browser, triggering JavaScript execution.
4. JavaScript dynamically creates and downloads the malicious payload onto the victim's machine.
5. Victim executes the downloaded payload, leading to further compromise.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers frequently utilize HTML Smuggling in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Access Stage**: Primarily used to bypass email security gateways, web proxies, and antivirus solutions during phishing campaigns.
* **Delivery Stage**: Effective in delivering malware payloads, such as remote access trojans (RATs), ransomware, or credential-stealing malware, directly onto victim endpoints.
* **Targeted Attacks**: Commonly leveraged in spear-phishing campaigns targeting specific organizations or individuals, especially when attackers anticipate strong perimeter defenses.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Operations**: Used by sophisticated threat actors to evade detection and maintain stealth during long-term infiltration campaigns.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting HTML Smuggling can be challenging due to its inherent obfuscation and bypass capabilities. However, organizations can employ various detection methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  * Monitoring suspicious file creation and execution originating from browsers or email clients.
  * Identifying unusual JavaScript execution behavior within browsers.
* **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)**:
  * Detecting abnormal HTML attachments or scripts embedded within email traffic.
  * Identifying suspicious HTML or JavaScript payloads in network traffic through deep packet inspection.
* **Behavioral Analytics**:
  * Analyzing abnormal browser behavior, such as sudden file downloads triggered by JavaScript without user interaction.
  * Identifying unusual patterns of browser-generated file downloads.
* **Sandbox Analysis**:
  * Executing suspicious HTML attachments within sandbox environments to observe JavaScript behavior and dynamic file generation.
* **Email Security Gateways**:
  * Inspecting HTML attachments for embedded JavaScript or encoded payloads.
  * Flagging emails containing HTML files with suspicious scripting or obfuscation patterns.
* **Specific IoCs**:
  * HTML files containing suspicious JavaScript functions designed to decode Base64-encoded data.
  * Suspicious use of JavaScript Blob objects or data URLs (`data:text/html;base64,...`) within HTML attachments.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of HTML Smuggling is critical due to its significant potential impacts on systems and networks:

* **Initial Compromise**: HTML Smuggling enables attackers to bypass traditional perimeter defenses, facilitating initial foothold establishment within the victim environment.
* **Malware Delivery**: Attackers frequently deliver dangerous payloads, including ransomware, spyware, credential stealers, and remote access trojans, leading to severe data breaches and financial losses.
* **Stealth and Evasion**: The obfuscated nature of HTML Smuggling allows attackers to evade detection, prolonging dwell time within compromised environments and increasing potential damage.
* **Increased Risk of Data Exfiltration**: Once attackers establish persistence, they may escalate privileges, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive information, causing severe business impacts.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Consequences**: Failure to detect and mitigate attacks leveraging HTML Smuggling can result in regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating HTML Smuggling attacks include:

* **NOBELIUM (UNC2452) Campaign**:
  * Attack Scenario: The threat actor behind the SolarWinds compromise leveraged HTML Smuggling in targeted spear-phishing campaigns.
  * Tools Used: Malicious HTML attachments embedded JavaScript code to dynamically generate and download ISO files containing malware payloads.
  * Impact: Initial access facilitated further lateral movement and data exfiltration, leading to a sophisticated supply-chain compromise affecting numerous organizations and government entities.
* **Qakbot (Qbot) Malware Campaigns**:
  * Attack Scenario: Attackers delivered Qakbot malware via phishing emails containing HTML attachments embedded with JavaScript code.
  * Tools Used: HTML Smuggling techniques utilizing JavaScript Blob objects and Base64 encoding to dynamically generate ZIP archives containing malicious payloads.
  * Impact: Successful infections resulted in credential theft, unauthorized financial transactions, and further distribution of ransomware payloads such as REvil.
* **IcedID Malware Distribution**:
  * Attack Scenario: Attackers used HTML Smuggling to bypass email security gateways, delivering malicious payloads to targeted organizations.
  * Tools Used: JavaScript embedded within HTML attachments to dynamically generate and download malicious Office documents containing macros.
  * Impact: Compromised endpoints led to credential harvesting, lateral movement, and deployment of additional malware, including ransomware.

These examples illustrate the widespread adoption of HTML Smuggling by sophisticated threat actors, highlighting the critical need for proactive detection and mitigation strategies.

# SSH Authorized Keys

## Information

* Name: SSH Authorized Keys
* ID: T1098.004
* Tactics: [TA0003](../), [TA0004](../../ta0004/)
* Technique: [T1098](./)

## Introduction

SSH Authorized Keys (T1098.004) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader Account Manipulation (T1098) technique. Attackers leverage this method by adding or modifying SSH authorized keys, enabling persistent, passwordless access to compromised Linux or Unix-based systems. This allows adversaries to maintain long-term persistence and evade traditional authentication mechanisms, simplifying lateral movement and further exploitation.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

SSH (Secure Shell) provides secure remote login capabilities, typically authenticating users via passwords or cryptographic keys. The authorized\_keys file, usually located at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, contains public keys that grant access without requiring a password.

Attackers exploiting this sub-technique typically follow these steps:

1. **Initial Access**:
   * Exploit vulnerabilities or stolen credentials to gain initial access to the target system.
   * Use existing compromised accounts or escalate privileges to gain write access to the victim user's SSH configuration.
2. **Key Generation and Placement**:
   * Generate a new SSH key pair (`ssh-keygen`) on attacker-controlled infrastructure.
   *   Insert the attacker's public key into the victim user's `authorized_keys` file, often using commands such as:

       ```bash
       echo "<attacker_public_key>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
       ```
   * Alternatively, attackers may overwrite existing keys or modify permissions to avoid suspicion.
3. **Persistence and Access**:
   * Once the public key is in place, attackers can log in remotely without providing passwords, bypassing traditional authentication logging.
   * Attackers may modify file permissions (`chmod 600 authorized_keys`) and timestamps (`touch -r`) to mask their activity.
4. **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:
   * Attackers may escalate privileges by compromising administrative or root accounts.
   * Attackers can propagate their keys across multiple systems, enabling lateral movement.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ SSH Authorized Keys manipulation in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Persistence**:
  * Maintaining long-term, stealthy access to compromised systems after initial intrusion.
  * Avoiding repeated exploitation or credential reuse, reducing detection probability.
* **Lateral Movement**:
  * Propagating access across multiple compromised hosts within the network.
  * Simplifying lateral movement by eliminating the need to repeatedly authenticate with passwords.
* **Privilege Escalation**:
  * Gaining root or administrative-level access by inserting keys into privileged user accounts.
  * Facilitating future privilege escalation attempts and simplifying administrative access.
* **Data Exfiltration and Command-and-Control (C2)**:
  * Establishing secure, encrypted channels for data exfiltration or command-and-control operations.
  * Reducing detection risks by leveraging legitimate SSH traffic.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting unauthorized modifications to SSH authorized keys involves monitoring various indicators and employing multiple detection methods, including:

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:
  * Monitoring changes to critical files such as `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
  * Tools: OSSEC, Tripwire, AIDE, Auditd.
* **Audit Logging and Alerts**:
  * Enabling audit logging to track file modifications (`auditd` rules for authorized\_keys).
  *   Example audit rule:

      ```bash
      -w /home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys -p wa -k ssh_key_modification
      ```
  * Monitoring alerts for unauthorized file edits or unexpected SSH key additions.
* **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection**:
  * Identifying unusual SSH login patterns, such as logins from unfamiliar IP addresses or at unusual times.
  * Using SIEM solutions (Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar) to correlate SSH login events with authorized\_keys changes.
* **Host-based Detection**:
  * Regularly scanning authorized\_keys files for unfamiliar or unauthorized public keys.
  * Comparing current keys against a known whitelist or baseline.
* **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
  * Monitoring network traffic for unusual SSH sessions or data exfiltration attempts.
  * Identifying SSH connections to external, unknown, or suspicious IP addresses.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

* Unrecognized public keys in `authorized_keys`.
* Unauthorized file permission changes on `.ssh` directories or authorized\_keys files.
* SSH logins from unknown or suspicious IP addresses.
* Unusual SSH login times and frequencies.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Identifying SSH Authorized Keys manipulation early is critical due to its severe potential impacts, including:

* **Persistent Unauthorized Access**:
  * Attackers gain persistent, stealthy access, making remediation challenging.
  * Unauthorized access may persist even after password changes or account lockouts.
* **Privilege Escalation and Administrative Control**:
  * Attackers can escalate privileges by inserting keys into privileged accounts, significantly increasing their control over systems and networks.
* **Data Exfiltration and Intellectual Property Theft**:
  * Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data securely and stealthily via encrypted SSH channels, causing significant financial and reputational damage.
* **Lateral Movement and Network Compromise**:
  * Attackers can propagate their access across multiple systems, increasing the scope and severity of breaches.
  * Networks can become extensively compromised, complicating containment and remediation efforts.
* **Evasion of Traditional Security Controls**:
  * SSH key-based authentication bypasses traditional password-based monitoring and detection mechanisms, making unauthorized access harder to detect.

Early detection helps minimize damage, reduces remediation costs, and prevents attackers from establishing long-term footholds.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of SSH Authorized Keys manipulation include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  * Russian state-sponsored group known to use SSH keys for persistent access.
  * Attackers inserted their own SSH keys into compromised systems to maintain long-term access and evade detection.
  * Impact: Persistent espionage, theft of sensitive government and commercial information.
* **Operation Windigo**:
  * Large-scale Linux malware campaign that compromised thousands of servers.
  * Attackers inserted malicious SSH keys into authorized\_keys files for persistent access and lateral movement.
  * Impact: Spam distribution, credential theft, malware hosting, and extensive network compromise.
* **Cloud Hopper Campaign (APT10)**:
  * Chinese state-sponsored attackers compromised managed service providers (MSPs).
  * Attackers manipulated SSH authorized keys to persistently access client networks and systems.
  * Impact: Intellectual property theft, sensitive data exfiltration, extensive supply-chain compromise.
* **Crypto-mining Campaigns**:
  * Attackers compromised Linux servers and cloud resources, inserting SSH keys to maintain persistent access.
  * Used persistent access to deploy crypto-mining malware, causing resource exhaustion and financial losses.

These examples highlight the widespread use and significant impact of SSH Authorized Keys manipulation in real-world attacks, emphasizing the importance of robust detection and prevention measures.

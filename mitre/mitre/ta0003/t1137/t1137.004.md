# Outlook Home Page

## Information

* Name: Outlook Home Page
* ID: T1137.004
* Tactics: [TA0003](../)
* Technique: [T1137](./)

## Introduction

Outlook Home Page (T1137.004) is a sub-technique of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the parent technique Office Application Startup (T1137). This method involves adversaries leveraging Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to achieve persistence and execute malicious payloads. By configuring Outlook to load a malicious URL or file upon startup, attackers can silently execute code, maintain persistence, and potentially escalate privileges within compromised environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The Outlook Home Page feature allows users to set a web page or URL to load automatically when Outlook starts or when a particular folder is accessed. Attackers exploit this feature by configuring a malicious URL or local file path that points to attacker-controlled content. This malicious content can then execute scripts or code within the context of Outlook, potentially bypassing security controls.

Technical details and execution methods include:

* **Registry Manipulation:** Attackers typically modify registry keys associated with Outlook folders to set a malicious Home Page URL:
  *   Registry path example:

      ```
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Outlook\Today\UserDefinedUrl
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Outlook\Today\Url
      ```
  * These keys specify the URL or file Outlook loads upon startup or folder selection.
* **Malicious Payload Delivery:** The malicious URL may host scripts (JavaScript, VBScript) or embedded ActiveX controls that execute malware on the victim's system.
* **Use of Local Resources:** Attackers can point the Home Page URL to local files (e.g., HTML files with embedded scripts), minimizing network detection and avoiding external requests.
* **Persistence Mechanism:** Once configured, the malicious Home Page loads automatically each time Outlook starts or the user accesses the specified folder, providing persistent execution of malicious payloads.
* **Privilege Escalation Potential:** Execution within Outlook's context may allow attackers to leverage user privileges, gather sensitive information, or pivot to additional systems within the network.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ the Outlook Home Page sub-technique during the following attack scenarios and stages:

* **Persistence Stage:** To maintain persistent access after initial compromise, attackers configure the Outlook Home Page to execute malicious code each time Outlook launches.
* **Reconnaissance and Credential Harvesting:** Malicious scripts executed through Outlook Home Pages may collect user credentials, emails, contacts, or sensitive information, facilitating further attacks.
* **Internal Pivoting and Lateral Movement:** Attackers may use this technique within an enterprise environment to move laterally or escalate privileges by leveraging trusted Outlook processes.
* **Stealthy Malware Distribution:** By embedding malicious content within legitimate applications (Outlook), attackers can bypass common endpoint security measures and evade detection.
* **Targeted Attacks and Spear-Phishing Campaigns:** Often observed in targeted attacks, where adversaries have initial access and seek stealthy persistence mechanisms.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of the Outlook Home Page sub-technique can be achieved through various monitoring strategies, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Registry Monitoring:**
  *   Monitor modifications to Outlook-related registry keys, especially:

      ```
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Outlook\Today\UserDefinedUrl
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Outlook\Today\Url
      ```
  * Alert on unexpected URL or file path changes to these keys.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools:**
  * EDR solutions can detect suspicious Outlook process behaviors, such as launching scripts or spawning unusual child processes.
* **Network Monitoring:**
  * Monitor outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic originating from Outlook processes to unexpected or unknown domains.
  * Identify anomalous patterns or repeated requests to suspicious URLs.
* **File System Monitoring:**
  * Track creation or modification of local HTML or script files referenced by Outlook Home Page configurations.
* **Behavioral Analytics and SIEM Solutions:**
  * Correlate events involving Outlook processes executing scripts or accessing unusual URLs.
  * Alert on abnormal user behavior patterns or unexpected Outlook startup behaviors.

Indicators of compromise (IoCs) include:

* Suspicious URLs or file paths configured in Outlook registry keys.
* Unusual outbound network connections initiated by Outlook.exe.
* Unexpected scripts or HTML files stored locally and referenced by Outlook.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of the Outlook Home Page sub-technique is critical due to the following potential impacts on systems and networks:

* **Persistent Access:** Attackers can reliably maintain persistent execution within legitimate Outlook processes, complicating remediation efforts.
* **Credential Theft and Data Exfiltration:** Malicious scripts executed via Outlook may harvest sensitive information, credentials, emails, or contacts, leading to data breaches or further exploitation.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:** Execution within user context and trusted applications allows adversaries to escalate privileges or pivot internally, significantly increasing the scope and impact of attacks.
* **Stealth and Evasion:** Exploiting legitimate application features (Outlook Home Page) allows attackers to evade traditional antivirus or endpoint security controls, prolonging the attacker’s dwell time.
* **Reputational and Operational Impact:** Compromise of email clients and related data can significantly disrupt organizational communication, operations, and reputation.

Proactive detection and response minimize the attacker’s dwell time, reduce potential data loss, and mitigate broader network compromise.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of Outlook Home Page sub-technique include:

* **APT33 (Elfin):**
  * This Iranian threat actor has leveraged Outlook Home Page persistence to maintain long-term access to compromised networks.
  * Attackers modified Outlook registry keys to reference malicious HTML pages containing JavaScript payloads, enabling persistent execution and credential theft.
  * Impact included prolonged espionage operations, credential harvesting, and lateral movement within victim organizations.
* **Operation Sharpshooter:**
  * This cyber-espionage campaign utilized Outlook Home Page persistence to execute malicious scripts embedded in HTML pages hosted locally or remotely.
  * Attackers maintained stealthy persistence, executed reconnaissance, and exfiltrated sensitive data from targeted organizations.
* **FIN7 Cybercrime Group:**
  * FIN7 has been observed using Outlook Home Page persistence to deliver malicious payloads and maintain persistent access within compromised financial institutions.
  * Leveraged malicious HTML pages to execute JavaScript payloads, download additional malware, and exfiltrate sensitive financial data.

In each scenario, attackers leveraged Outlook's legitimate functionality to achieve stealthy, persistent, and impactful compromise, highlighting the importance of robust detection and mitigation strategies.

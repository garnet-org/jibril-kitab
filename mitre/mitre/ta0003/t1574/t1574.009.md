# Path Interception by Unquoted Path

## Information

* Name: Path Interception by Unquoted Path
* ID: T1574.009
* Tactics: [TA0003](../), [TA0004](../../ta0004/), [TA0005](../../ta0005/)
* Technique: [T1574](./)

## Introduction

Path Interception by Unquoted Path (MITRE ATT\&CK ID: T1574.009) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, falling under the broader category of Hijack Execution Flow (T1574). This technique exploits the Windows operating system's handling of file paths containing spaces, specifically when executable paths are not enclosed in quotation marks. Attackers leverage this vulnerability to execute malicious payloads by placing executables in strategic locations, causing legitimate applications or services to inadvertently execute malicious binaries.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Path Interception by Unquoted Path occurs when Windows attempts to execute a program with a path containing spaces that is not properly enclosed in quotation marks. Windows interprets the space-separated segments as potential executable paths, sequentially searching and executing the first matching executable it finds.

Technical execution steps:

1. **Identify vulnerable applications or services:**
   * Attackers scan registry entries, service configurations, and scheduled tasks for executable paths that are unquoted and contain spaces.
   * Vulnerable paths typically resemble `C:\Program Files\Example Folder\example.exe` without quotes.
2. **Determine executable search order:**
   *   Windows attempts to execute binaries by parsing paths at each space character. For example, given the unquoted path:

       ```
       C:\Program Files\Example Folder\example.exe
       ```

       Windows searches for executables in the following order:

       * `C:\Program.exe`
       * `C:\Program Files\Example.exe`
       * `C:\Program Files\Example Folder\example.exe`
3. **Placement of malicious executables:**
   * Attackers place malicious executables at strategic locations matching the parsed paths, such as `C:\Program Files\Example.exe`.
   * When the legitimate application or service runs, Windows inadvertently executes the malicious executable first.
4. **Privilege escalation and persistence:**
   * Often exploited to achieve privilege escalation and persistence.
   * Malicious executables inherit privileges associated with the compromised application or service, potentially granting elevated privileges.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ Path Interception by Unquoted Path in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Access and Persistence:**
  * Attackers exploit vulnerable applications or services to gain initial foothold or maintain persistent access to compromised systems.
  * Commonly leveraged during lateral movement within Windows environments.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Exploiting services or scheduled tasks running under higher privileges (Local System, Administrator) allows attackers to escalate privileges from standard user accounts.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Malicious execution through legitimate services or applications helps attackers evade detection mechanisms that rely on process integrity checks.
* **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:**
  * Attackers scan internal networks, identify vulnerable systems, and exploit unquoted paths to move laterally within the environment.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Path Interception by Unquoted Path involves a combination of proactive and reactive measures, including:

* **Registry and Configuration Auditing:**
  * Regularly auditing Windows registry entries, scheduled tasks, and service configurations to identify unquoted executable paths.
  * Automated scripts or tools (e.g., PowerSploit, PowerUp, Sysinternals Autoruns) can detect vulnerable paths.
* **File System Monitoring:**
  * Monitoring file system changes, especially the creation of executables in unusual or suspicious locations such as root directories (`C:\`) or common directories (`C:\Program Files\`).
  * Leveraging file integrity monitoring tools (FIM) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
* **Process Monitoring and Behavioral Analysis:**
  * Monitoring and analyzing process creation events for unusual parent-child relationships.
  * Utilizing tools like Sysmon, Process Monitor, EDR solutions, or SIEM platforms to identify anomalous process executions.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual executables appearing in directories such as:
    * `C:\Program.exe`
    * `C:\Program Files\Common.exe`
    * `C:\Program Files (x86)\Example.exe`
  * Unexpected processes spawned from legitimate services or scheduled tasks.
  * Suspicious event logs indicating failed attempts to execute misconfigured paths.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection and mitigation of Path Interception by Unquoted Path is critical due to its potential impacts on systems and networks:

* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers exploiting this technique can escalate privileges, gaining administrative or SYSTEM-level access, significantly increasing their ability to compromise the environment.
* **Persistence and Long-term Access:**
  * Exploiting unquoted paths allows attackers to embed persistent backdoors or payloads within legitimate system processes, complicating remediation efforts.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Malicious payload execution via legitimate services or applications complicates detection efforts, enabling attackers to evade conventional security controls.
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Malicious payloads executed through critical services or applications can cause disruptions, system instability, or data loss, affecting organizational productivity and business continuity.
* **Data Exfiltration and Information Theft:**
  * Attackers may leverage this technique to gain access to sensitive data, intellectual property, or credentials, leading to substantial financial and reputational damages.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Path Interception by Unquoted Path include:

* **Common Vulnerable Software and Services:**
  * Third-party applications or custom-developed software frequently contain unquoted paths in their installers, service configurations, or scheduled tasks.
  * Widely used applications have historically been vulnerable, prompting security advisories and patches.
* **PowerSploit's PowerUp Module:**
  * Attackers commonly use PowerSploit's PowerUp module to quickly identify and exploit unquoted path vulnerabilities within compromised Windows environments.
  * PowerUp automates the discovery of vulnerable services and scheduled tasks, facilitating privilege escalation.
* **APT and Cybercriminal Groups:**
  * Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and cybercriminals have leveraged unquoted path vulnerabilities during targeted intrusions to establish persistence and escalate privileges.
  * For example, threat actors associated with FIN6 and other financially motivated groups have utilized this technique to maintain access within compromised environments.
* **Security Research and Penetration Testing:**
  * Security researchers and penetration testers frequently exploit this vulnerability to demonstrate risks and recommend remediation strategies to organizations.
  * Publicly documented penetration testing reports and vulnerability assessments often highlight this technique as a prevalent security oversight.
* **Incident Response Cases:**
  * Incident response firms regularly document incidents where attackers exploited unquoted path vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.
  * Investigation reports frequently highlight the presence of malicious executables in directories such as `C:\Program Files\malicious.exe`, underscoring the importance of addressing this vulnerability proactively.

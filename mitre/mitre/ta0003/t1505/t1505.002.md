# Transport Agent

## Information

* Name: Transport Agent
* ID: T1505.002
* Tactics: [TA0003](../)
* Technique: [T1505](./)

## Introduction

Transport Agent (T1505.002) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework's Server Software Component (T1505) technique. It specifically refers to adversaries abusing Microsoft Exchange transport agents—software components that process email messages passing through an Exchange server—to gain persistence, intercept email communications, or execute malicious payloads. Transport agents offer attackers a stealthy method of maintaining access and monitoring email traffic without easily raising suspicion, as these components typically run with high privileges within Exchange environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Transport agents in Microsoft Exchange Server are custom software components designed to process, modify, or inspect email messages as they flow through the Exchange Transport pipeline. Attackers exploit this functionality by installing malicious transport agents to achieve persistent access, intercept sensitive email communications, or facilitate lateral movement.

Technical details and execution methods include:

* **Installation of Malicious Transport Agents**:
  * Attackers typically use administrative privileges or compromised credentials to register a malicious transport agent DLL using PowerShell cmdlets such as `Install-TransportAgent`.
  *   Example command:

      ```powershell
      Install-TransportAgent -Name "MaliciousAgent" -TransportAgentFactory "MaliciousAgent.Factory" -AssemblyPath "C:\Windows\System32\malicious.dll"
      Enable-TransportAgent -Identity "MaliciousAgent"
      ```
* **Execution and Persistence**:
  * Once installed and enabled, the malicious transport agent executes automatically with every processed email, providing persistent access and the ability to intercept or manipulate email traffic.
  * Transport agents are loaded and executed within the Exchange Transport service (`MSExchangeTransport.exe`), typically running with SYSTEM-level privileges.
* **Email Interception and Manipulation**:
  * Malicious transport agents can silently intercept, copy, or redirect incoming and outgoing emails.
  * Attackers can leverage these agents to monitor sensitive communications, exfiltrate data, or inject malicious payloads into legitimate email traffic.
* **Stealth and Obfuscation**:
  * Transport agents can be difficult to detect as they blend seamlessly into legitimate Exchange operations.
  * Attackers often disguise malicious transport agents using legitimate-sounding names and file locations to evade suspicion.
* **Removal and Cleanup**:
  * Attackers may attempt to remove or disable logging and audit trails related to transport agent installation or modification to avoid detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically deploy malicious transport agents in the following scenarios and stages of an attack:

* **Persistence Stage**:
  * After initial compromise, attackers install transport agents to maintain long-term, stealthy access to email servers.
* **Credential Access and Reconnaissance**:
  * Attackers intercept emails containing sensitive credentials, business information, or personal identifiable information (PII).
* **Data Exfiltration Stage**:
  * Malicious transport agents can silently forward or copy sensitive email communications to attacker-controlled external addresses or servers.
* **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation**:
  * Attackers leverage intercepted emails containing credentials or sensitive information to facilitate lateral movement within the compromised environment.
* **Espionage and Cybercrime Operations**:
  * Nation-state actors and cybercriminals commonly use transport agents in targeted espionage campaigns or financially motivated attacks to monitor and extract valuable communications.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs) for malicious transport agents include:

* **Monitoring Exchange Server Logs and Audit Trails**:
  * Regular review of Exchange Management Shell command logs to identify suspicious commands such as `Install-TransportAgent`, `Enable-TransportAgent`, or `Set-TransportAgent`.
* **Inspecting Registered Transport Agents**:
  *   Periodically executing Exchange Management Shell commands to list installed transport agents:

      ```powershell
      Get-TransportAgent
      ```
  * Investigating unknown or suspicious transport agents and verifying their legitimacy.
* **Monitoring File System and DLL Loading**:
  * Monitoring Exchange Transport service (`MSExchangeTransport.exe`) for unusual DLL loading activities using tools like Sysinternals Process Monitor or EDR solutions.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions**:
  * Deploying advanced EDR tools capable of detecting malicious DLL injection, anomalous process behaviors, and suspicious PowerShell activities.
* **Behavioral Analytics and SIEM Solutions**:
  * Using SIEM solutions to correlate suspicious Exchange administrative activities with other indicators of compromise.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Presence of unknown or unsigned DLL files in Exchange directories (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\TransportRoles\agents\`).
  *   Suspicious registry keys related to transport agents:

      ```
      HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeTransport\Agents\
      ```
  * Unexplained email forwarding rules or email traffic anomalies.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting malicious transport agents is critical due to their potential severe impacts on systems, networks, and organizations:

* **Data Loss and Exfiltration**:
  * Attackers can silently intercept and exfiltrate sensitive emails containing confidential business information, intellectual property, or personal data.
* **Credential Theft and Privilege Escalation**:
  * Intercepted emails may contain user credentials, enabling attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, and compromise additional systems.
* **Persistent and Stealthy Access**:
  * Malicious transport agents provide attackers persistent, stealthy access, making them difficult to detect and remove if not identified promptly.
* **Operational Disruption and Reputation Damage**:
  * Successful email interception or manipulation can lead to significant operational disruptions, financial losses, regulatory penalties, and damage to organizational reputation.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Risks**:
  * Organizations may face compliance violations and regulatory fines if attackers exfiltrate sensitive or regulated data.
* **Early Detection and Mitigation**:
  * Timely detection of malicious transport agents enables rapid containment, remediation, and prevention of further compromise, minimizing overall impact.

## Examples

Real-world examples of malicious transport agent usage include:

* **LightNeuron Malware**:
  * A sophisticated backdoor transport agent discovered by ESET researchers in 2019.
  * Used by the cyber espionage group Turla (APT28) to spy on email communications in targeted organizations.
  * Capabilities included email interception, email modification, and stealthy data exfiltration.
  * Impacted multiple diplomatic and government organizations globally.
* **Operation Exchange Marauder**:
  * Attackers installed malicious transport agents to intercept sensitive emails containing business-critical information and credentials.
  * Attackers leveraged intercepted credentials for lateral movement and further compromise within victim networks.
* **HAFNIUM Attack Campaign (2021 Exchange Server Exploits)**:
  * Attackers leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server to install malicious web shells and transport agents.
  * Enabled persistent email interception, data exfiltration, and espionage activities targeting numerous organizations worldwide.
* **FIN7 Cybercrime Group Attacks**:
  * FIN7 attackers reportedly used malicious transport agents to intercept emails containing financial information, facilitating financial fraud and theft.
* **Tools and Techniques Commonly Observed**:
  * Attackers frequently use PowerShell scripts, custom DLLs, and legitimate Exchange cmdlets (`Install-TransportAgent`, `Enable-TransportAgent`) to install and maintain malicious transport agents.
  * Common impacts include sensitive data exfiltration, credential theft, espionage, and financial fraud.

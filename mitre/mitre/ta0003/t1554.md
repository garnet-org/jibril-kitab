# Compromise Host Software Binary

## Information

* Name: Compromise Host Software Binary
* ID: T1554
* Tactics: [TA0003](./)

## Introduction

The MITRE ATT\&CK technique "Compromise Host Software Binary" (T1553.001) involves attackers modifying legitimate binaries or software components installed on a host system to execute unauthorized malicious code. By compromising trusted binaries, adversaries gain persistence, evade detection, and escalate privileges, leveraging the inherent trust placed in legitimate software. This technique is categorized under the Persistence tactic within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employing this technique typically modify existing legitimate binaries or software components on a host system to include malicious payloads. Technical details can include:

* **Binary Patching:**
  * Attackers directly modify binary executables by injecting malicious code or altering existing code sections.
  * Tools such as hex editors, binary patching utilities, or custom scripts may be used.
* **DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
  * Malicious DLL files are placed in directories searched by legitimate software, causing the legitimate binary to load and execute attacker-controlled DLLs.
* **Code Injection and Hooking:**
  * Attackers inject malicious code into legitimate software processes at runtime using techniques like reflective DLL injection or API hooking.
* **Software Update Manipulation:**
  * Attackers compromise software update mechanisms or repositories to distribute maliciously modified binaries to victim systems.

Real-world procedures include:

* Altering system utilities or administrative tools (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe, taskmgr.exe) to execute malicious payloads.
* Compromising third-party application binaries (e.g., productivity tools, antivirus software, VPN clients) to evade detection.
* Modifying binaries to include backdoors, keyloggers, or command-and-control (C2) communication modules.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly utilize the technique "Compromise Host Software Binary" during various stages and scenarios, such as:

* **Persistence:**
  * Establishing long-term footholds on compromised systems by embedding malicious code into trusted binaries.
  * Maintaining persistent access even after system reboots or software updates.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Modifying binaries executed with elevated privileges to escalate attacker permissions.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Avoiding detection by embedding malicious functionality within trusted software, making it difficult for security tools to identify anomalies.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
  * Compromising software vendors or distribution channels to distribute maliciously altered software binaries to multiple targets simultaneously.
* **Targeted Attacks:**
  * Highly targeted intrusion campaigns aiming at specific high-value systems or organizations, ensuring stealth and long-term persistence.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of compromised host software binaries typically involves several approaches, including:

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
  * Monitoring and alerting on unauthorized changes to critical system binaries or software components.
  * Tools: Tripwire, OSSEC, AIDE.
* **Behavioral Analysis:**
  * Detecting anomalous behavior of known binaries, such as unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or suspicious process spawning.
  * Tools: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions (e.g., CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint).
* **Binary Hash Analysis:**
  * Comparing cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA-256) of binaries against known good baselines or trusted repositories.
  * Tools: VirusTotal, internal hash databases, YARA rules.
* **Digital Signature Verification:**
  * Validating digital signatures of binaries to detect unauthorized modifications or unsigned code execution.
  * Tools: Windows built-in tools (sigcheck.exe), Linux package management tools (rpm -V, dpkg --verify).
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unexpected binaries or DLL files in system directories.
  * Unusual file modification timestamps or file sizes.
  * Suspicious registry entries related to binary execution paths.
  * Unexpected outbound network connections from trusted software processes.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of compromised host software binaries is critical due to the severe potential impacts on systems and networks:

* **Persistence and Long-Term Access:**
  * Attackers can maintain persistent footholds, enabling prolonged espionage, data exfiltration, or sabotage activities.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:**
  * Compromised binaries executed with elevated privileges can enable attackers to escalate privileges and move laterally across networks.
* **Data Exfiltration and Intellectual Property Theft:**
  * Maliciously modified software can silently exfiltrate sensitive data or intellectual property to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
* **System Integrity and Reliability:**
  * Unauthorized modifications to critical binaries can degrade system stability, reliability, and introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Supply Chain Risks:**
  * Compromised software binaries distributed via trusted channels pose significant risks to multiple organizations simultaneously, greatly amplifying the impact.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Implications:**
  * Failure to detect and mitigate compromised binaries can lead to regulatory penalties, loss of customer trust, and significant financial damages.

## Examples

Real-world examples of attacks involving compromised host software binaries include:

* **CCleaner Supply Chain Attack (2017):**
  * Attackers compromised CCleaner's software update infrastructure and distributed maliciously modified binaries to millions of users.
  * Malicious payload enabled attackers to collect system information and execute additional malware selectively on targeted systems.
  * Impact: Thousands of infected systems, espionage against major technology and telecommunications companies.
* **NotPetya Attack (2017):**
  * Attackers compromised the software update mechanism of Ukrainian accounting software "M.E.Doc" to distribute malicious binaries containing destructive payloads.
  * Impact: Massive global disruption, billions of dollars in damages, widespread system destruction across multiple industries.
* **ShadowHammer (ASUS Live Update Attack, 2019):**
  * Attackers compromised ASUS's Live Update utility to distribute maliciously modified binaries to ASUS laptop users.
  * Attackers selectively targeted specific MAC addresses to deliver additional malware.
  * Impact: Thousands of compromised systems, targeted espionage operations against selected high-value individuals.
* **SolarWinds Orion Attack (2020):**
  * Attackers compromised SolarWinds' software build process, embedding malicious code (SUNBURST backdoor) into legitimate software updates.
  * Impact: Extensive espionage operation affecting multiple U.S. government agencies, technology companies, and critical infrastructure organizations.

Tools commonly used by attackers include:

* Binary patching tools (e.g., Hex editors, binary diff tools).
* DLL injection and hooking frameworks (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Metasploit).
* Custom-developed malware backdoors and implants tailored for embedding into legitimate binaries.

The impacts of these attacks include data breaches, economic losses, espionage, and significant operational disruptions, underscoring the critical importance of detecting and mitigating compromised host software binaries promptly.

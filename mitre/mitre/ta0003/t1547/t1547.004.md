# Winlogon Helper DLL

## Information

* Name: Winlogon Helper DLL
* ID: T1547.004
* Tactics: [TA0003](../), [TA0004](../../ta0004/)
* Technique: [T1547](./)

## Introduction

Winlogon Helper DLL (T1547.004) is a sub-technique of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework's Persistence technique (T1547). This sub-technique involves adversaries abusing the Windows Winlogon process, specifically by registering malicious DLLs that the Winlogon process loads upon user logon events. Attackers leverage this method to achieve persistence and execute malicious payloads automatically whenever a user logs on to the compromised system.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The Winlogon Helper DLL technique exploits the legitimate Windows Winlogon process, a critical component responsible for handling user logon and logoff operations. Winlogon loads specific DLL files defined in registry keys during system startup or user logon. Attackers manipulate these registry entries to point to malicious DLLs, which are then automatically loaded by the Winlogon process.

Key registry locations typically targeted by attackers include:

* `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify`
* `HKLM\Software\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify`

Technical process involved:

1. Adversary gains initial access to the system through phishing, exploitation, or lateral movement.
2. Malicious DLL is placed on the compromised system, typically in directories such as:
   * `%SystemRoot%\System32\`
   * `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\`
   * `%AppData%\`
   * `%ProgramData%\`
3. Registry keys under Winlogon Notify are modified or created to reference the malicious DLL.
4. Upon next user logon or system restart, Winlogon process loads the malicious DLL, executing attacker-defined code.

Real-world procedures include:

* DLL injection into legitimate Winlogon threads.
* DLL sideloading by placing malicious DLLs alongside legitimate executables.
* Obfuscation techniques to evade detection, such as DLL packing, encryption, or reflective DLL loading.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly use Winlogon Helper DLL technique under the following scenarios and attack stages:

* Persistence: Ensuring continued access to compromised systems after initial exploitation.
* Privilege Escalation: Leveraging Winlogon privileges to execute malicious DLLs with elevated permissions.
* Credential Theft: Capturing user credentials during logon events by injecting malicious code into the authentication process.
* Post-exploitation/Lateral Movement: Maintaining footholds on compromised hosts within internal networks for prolonged reconnaissance and data exfiltration.
* Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns: Maintaining stealthy persistence on targeted high-value systems.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Winlogon Helper DLL technique involves monitoring and analyzing system activities, registry modifications, and DLL loading behaviors. Common detection methods include:

* Monitoring Windows Registry keys:
  * Regularly auditing changes to the registry paths:
    * `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify`
    * `HKLM\Software\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify`
* Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions:
  * Identifying suspicious DLL loads by the Winlogon process.
  * Detecting abnormal DLL injection events and suspicious file paths.
* Sysmon and event log monitoring:
  * Using Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image Loaded) to detect DLL loading by Winlogon.
  * Monitoring Windows Security Event Logs for unusual logon behaviors or privilege escalations.
* File integrity monitoring:
  * Auditing changes in directories commonly targeted by attackers.
* Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
  * Unusual DLL files in system directories or user directories.
  * Malicious DLLs with suspicious filenames (randomly generated or mimicking legitimate DLLs).
  * Registry entries pointing to unexpected or unauthorized DLL paths.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of the Winlogon Helper DLL technique is critical due to its potential severe impact on compromised systems and networks. Possible impacts include:

* Persistent unauthorized access: Attackers maintain long-term stealthy access, complicating remediation efforts.
* Privilege escalation: Malicious DLLs loaded by Winlogon typically execute with elevated privileges, enabling attackers to gain administrative control.
* Credential harvesting: Attackers may intercept and steal user credentials during logon events, leading to further compromise of accounts and lateral movement.
* Data exfiltration and espionage: Persistent access allows attackers to continuously exfiltrate sensitive data undetected.
* System instability and corruption: Malicious code execution within critical system processes may lead to performance degradation, crashes, or corruption of system components.
* Difficulty in remediation: Persistence mechanisms embedded deeply within critical Windows processes require extensive analysis and cleanup efforts.

Early detection facilitates rapid incident response, reduces attacker dwell time, limits potential damage, and prevents further lateral movement within the network.

## Examples

Real-world examples and attack scenarios involving Winlogon Helper DLL include:

* **APT41 (Winnti)**:
  * Attackers used malicious DLLs loaded through Winlogon Notify registry entries to maintain persistence on targeted systems.
  * Malicious DLLs were used to inject code into legitimate processes, evade detection, and facilitate credential theft.
  * Impact included long-term espionage, intellectual property theft, and persistent access to sensitive corporate networks.
* **Carbanak/FIN7**:
  * Attackers leveraged Winlogon Helper DLL technique to maintain persistent access to financial institutions and retail environments.
  * DLLs loaded by Winlogon were used to capture credentials, perform lateral movement, and exfiltrate sensitive financial information.
  * Resulted in significant financial losses, data breaches, and compromised customer information.
* **TrickBot Malware**:
  * TrickBot operators utilized Winlogon Notify registry entries to load malicious DLLs as persistence mechanisms.
  * DLL injection facilitated credential theft, lateral movement, and deployment of subsequent ransomware payloads such as Ryuk.
  * Impact included ransomware attacks, data encryption, and significant disruption to business operations.

Tools commonly associated with this technique include:

* **Mimikatz**: May be loaded via Winlogon to capture credentials during user logon.
* **Cobalt Strike**: Framework capable of generating malicious DLL payloads for persistence via Winlogon registry keys.
* **Metasploit Framework**: Provides modules to create malicious DLL payloads for persistence and privilege escalation via Winlogon Notify.

Understanding and analyzing these real-world examples helps defenders recognize patterns, enhance detection capabilities, and develop effective mitigation strategies against the Winlogon Helper DLL technique.

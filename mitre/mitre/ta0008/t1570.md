# Lateral Tool Transfer

## Information

* Name: Lateral Tool Transfer
* ID: T1570
* Tactics: [TA0008](./)

## Introduction

Lateral Tool Transfer (Technique ID: T1570) in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework refers to adversaries transferring tools or files between systems within a compromised network. Attackers often perform lateral transfers after initial access to propagate malicious payloads, escalate privileges, or establish persistence across multiple hosts. By transferring tools laterally, adversaries minimize external network interactions, thus reducing detection opportunities and enhancing stealth.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Lateral Tool Transfer involves moving files, scripts, executables, or other malicious payloads between systems within a compromised environment. Attackers typically leverage legitimate system tools and protocols to blend in with normal network activities, making detection difficult. Common methods and mechanisms include:

* **Windows Admin Shares (SMB)**:
  * Attackers utilize built-in administrative shares (e.g., C$, ADMIN$) to transfer tools.
  * Authentication via compromised credentials enables seamless file transfers.
* **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**:
  * Attackers may leverage RDP clipboard sharing or mapped drives to transfer tools and files.
* **Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) and Secure Shell (SSH)**:
  * Attackers exploit SSH and SCP to transfer payloads between Unix/Linux systems.
* **PowerShell Remoting (WinRM)**:
  * Attackers may use PowerShell sessions to remotely transfer scripts and payloads.
* **BITSAdmin (Background Intelligent Transfer Service)**:
  * Leveraging BITS for stealthy file transfers within a network.
* **Third-party Tools and Frameworks**:
  * Tools such as PsExec, SMBexec, and Impacket facilitate lateral file transfers and execution.

Attackers often compress, encrypt, or obfuscate transferred files to evade detection mechanisms. Additionally, adversaries may delete transferred files after execution to reduce forensic evidence.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Lateral Tool Transfer typically occurs during multiple stages of an attack lifecycle, including:

* **Post-Exploitation**:
  * After initial compromise, attackers transfer additional payloads to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.
* **Lateral Movement**:
  * Attackers transfer tools to pivot laterally through the network, compromising additional systems.
* **Privilege Escalation**:
  * Payloads transferred laterally often include tools and exploits designed to escalate privileges on target systems.
* **Persistence**:
  * Attackers transfer persistence mechanisms such as backdoors, rootkits, or scheduled tasks to maintain long-term presence.
* **Data Exfiltration Preparation**:
  * Attackers transfer data collection scripts or exfiltration tools to gather and exfiltrate sensitive information.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Lateral Tool Transfer involves monitoring and analyzing internal network and host-level activities. Common detection methods and indicators include:

* **Network Monitoring and Analysis**:
  * Unusual SMB, RDP, SSH, SCP, or WinRM traffic between internal hosts.
  * High-volume or anomalous transfers between hosts not typically communicating.
* **Endpoint Monitoring and Logging**:
  * Monitoring Windows Event Logs (e.g., Event ID 5145 for SMB access).
  * Detecting creation or modification of files in administrative shares or unexpected directories.
  * Monitoring PowerShell logs for remote sessions and file transfers.
* **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection**:
  * Detecting deviations from normal baseline behaviors, such as unusual file types, sizes, or transfer times.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:
  * Detecting unexpected changes or additions to system files or directories.
* **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Presence of known lateral movement tools such as PsExec, Impacket scripts, or custom malware payloads.
  * Suspicious file hashes, filenames, or directories created during transfers.
  * Unexpected scheduled tasks or services created after lateral transfer events.

Security tools commonly used for detection:

* Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions
* Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems
* Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Lateral Tool Transfer is critical due to its potential significant impacts:

* **Rapid Network Compromise**:
  * Enables attackers to quickly propagate malware and compromise multiple hosts, increasing the attack surface and potential damage.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**:
  * Facilitates attackers gaining elevated privileges and establishing persistent footholds, complicating remediation efforts.
* **Data Theft and Exfiltration**:
  * Attackers transfer data collection and exfiltration tools, potentially leading to sensitive data loss, reputational damage, and compliance violations.
* **Increased Difficulty of Remediation**:
  * Early detection prevents attackers from establishing a widespread foothold, reducing remediation complexity and cost.
* **Reduced Detection Opportunities**:
  * Attackers minimize external network interactions by transferring tools internally, reducing visibility and detection opportunities, making internal monitoring essential.

Early detection and response to Lateral Tool Transfer significantly limit the attacker's ability to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and cause extensive damage within the compromised environment.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating Lateral Tool Transfer technique usage:

* **NotPetya Malware Attack (2017)**:
  * Attackers leveraged SMB (EternalBlue exploit) and PsExec to propagate malware laterally across networks, transferring malicious payloads rapidly between hosts.
  * Impact: Caused billions of dollars in damages globally, crippling critical infrastructure, financial institutions, and multinational corporations.
* **Ryuk Ransomware Attacks**:
  * Attackers frequently used SMB and administrative shares to transfer malicious payloads, scripts, and ransomware binaries between internal hosts.
  * Tools Used: PsExec, SMBexec, PowerShell scripts.
  * Impact: Significant downtime, data loss, and financial damage to healthcare, government, and corporate entities.
* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Operations**:
  * Utilized PowerShell Remoting and WinRM to transfer reconnaissance and persistence scripts internally within victim networks.
  * Impact: Long-term espionage, sensitive data exfiltration, and persistent footholds within compromised environments.
* **SamSam Ransomware**:
  * Attackers employed RDP and SMB protocols to transfer ransomware payloads laterally within compromised networks.
  * Impact: Severe disruption to healthcare and government organizations, significant ransom payments, and operational downtime.

These examples highlight the critical importance of monitoring and detecting Lateral Tool Transfer to prevent widespread network compromise, data breaches, and prolonged attacker persistence.

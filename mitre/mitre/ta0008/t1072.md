# Software Deployment Tools

## Information

* Name: Software Deployment Tools
* ID: T1072
* Tactics: [TA0002](../ta0002/), [TA0008](./)

## Introduction

Software Deployment Tools is a technique described in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under technique ID T1072. Attackers leverage legitimate software deployment tools and systems, such as SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager), Ansible, Puppet, Chef, or other enterprise software management tools, to distribute and execute malicious payloads across an environment. By exploiting trusted deployment mechanisms, adversaries can achieve persistence, lateral movement, and privilege escalation while minimizing suspicion and detection.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers using Software Deployment Tools typically exploit existing administrative infrastructure and automated deployment systems to distribute malware or execute malicious scripts. These tools are legitimately used by organizations to manage software installations, updates, and configurations across multiple endpoints and servers, making them attractive targets for attackers seeking stealthy propagation.

Key technical details include:

* **Exploitation of Legitimate Infrastructure**: Attackers compromise or gain administrative access to software deployment servers or management consoles, such as Microsoft SCCM, PDQ Deploy, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack, or Jenkins.
* **Malicious Package Creation**: Adversaries create or modify software installation packages, scripts, or update bundles to embed malicious payloads.
* **Deployment and Execution**: Leveraging existing automated deployment routines, attackers push malicious packages to multiple endpoints simultaneously, allowing rapid and stealthy propagation across the targeted network.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**: Deployment tools generally operate with administrative privileges, enabling attackers to achieve elevated privileges on endpoints and establish persistent footholds.
* **Use of Native Scripting and Automation**: Attackers may utilize built-in scripting languages (PowerShell, Bash, Python) and automation frameworks to blend malicious activities with legitimate administrative tasks.

Real-world procedures involve attackers modifying legitimate software deployments to embed backdoors, credential harvesting scripts, or ransomware payloads. These attacks are particularly effective because they exploit trusted internal processes, making detection and response challenging.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ Software Deployment Tools during various stages and scenarios of an intrusion:

* **Initial Access and Execution**:
  * After compromising administrative credentials or deployment infrastructure, attackers use these tools to execute payloads rapidly across multiple systems.
* **Lateral Movement**:
  * Attackers exploit deployment tools to propagate horizontally across networks, infecting numerous endpoints simultaneously.
* **Privilege Escalation**:
  * Leveraging deployment tools' inherent administrative privileges allows attackers to escalate privileges on compromised endpoints.
* **Persistence**:
  * Malicious packages or scripts deployed through these mechanisms can establish persistent footholds, ensuring attackers maintain long-term access.
* **Impact Stage (e.g., Ransomware Deployment)**:
  * Attackers frequently use software deployment tools to rapidly deploy ransomware payloads across large enterprise environments, maximizing impact and reducing response time.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting malicious use of software deployment tools requires comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple layers of enterprise infrastructure. Key detection methods include:

* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  * Monitor endpoints for unusual software installations, unexpected scripts, or anomalous binaries executed via deployment tools.
* **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection**:
  * Detect abnormal patterns in software deployment frequency, timing, and target endpoints.
  * Identify unusual administrative activity or unauthorized modifications to deployment packages.
* **Log Analysis and Centralized Monitoring**:
  * Analyze logs from deployment servers (e.g., SCCM, Ansible, Jenkins) for suspicious activity, unauthorized package modifications, or unexpected deployments.
  * Correlate deployment logs with endpoint security logs to discover discrepancies or suspicious behaviors.
* **Network Monitoring and IDS/IPS**:
  * Monitor network traffic for unusual data transfers originating from deployment infrastructure.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:
  * Detect unauthorized changes to software packages stored on deployment servers.
* **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unexpected or unauthorized packages appearing in deployment repositories.
  * Scripts or binaries with suspicious naming conventions or unusual file hashes.
  * Deployment activities outside normal maintenance windows or targeting unusual systems.
  * Unusual administrative account usage patterns or logins to deployment servers.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting malicious use of software deployment tools is crucial due to the significant potential impact on organizations:

* **Rapid and Widespread Infection**:
  * Attackers can quickly compromise numerous systems simultaneously, greatly amplifying damage and complicating containment efforts.
* **Elevated Privileges and Persistent Access**:
  * Deployment tools usually operate with high-level administrative privileges, enabling attackers to escalate privileges and maintain persistent footholds.
* **Stealth and Trust Abuse**:
  * Attackers exploit trusted internal processes, making malicious activities challenging to detect and attribute.
* **Potential for Extensive Damage**:
  * Malicious payloads deployed via these tools can include ransomware, data exfiltration scripts, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms, leading to severe operational disruptions and financial impact.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Risks**:
  * Failure to detect and mitigate attacks leveraging deployment tools can result in regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and reputational damage.
* **Early Detection and Response**:
  * Timely detection is essential to minimizing damage, preventing lateral movement, and reducing remediation costs.

## Examples

Several real-world examples highlight the malicious use of software deployment tools in cyberattacks:

* **NotPetya Attack (2017)**:
  * Attackers compromised Ukrainian software vendor M.E.Doc's update mechanism, deploying malicious payloads disguised as legitimate software updates.
  * The malware rapidly propagated through internal software deployment mechanisms, causing global disruption and billions of dollars in damages.
* **Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10)**:
  * Attackers compromised managed service providers (MSPs) and leveraged deployment tools to distribute malware and maintain persistent access across multiple client networks.
  * Attackers used legitimate deployment processes to blend malicious activities with normal administrative tasks, significantly complicating detection.
* **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020)**:
  * Adversaries infiltrated SolarWinds Orion software build processes, embedding malicious code into legitimate software updates.
  * Malicious updates were distributed via legitimate deployment channels, enabling attackers to access numerous high-profile organizations and government agencies.
* **ShadowHammer Attack (ASUS Live Update, 2019)**:
  * Attackers compromised ASUS's software update mechanism, distributing malicious updates via legitimate software deployment channels.
  * The attack impacted thousands of users globally, highlighting the effectiveness and stealth of compromising trusted deployment tools.

These examples demonstrate attackers' ability to exploit legitimate software deployment infrastructure, causing extensive damage, persistent breaches, and significant operational disruptions.

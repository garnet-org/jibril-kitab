# Internal Spearphishing

## Information

* Name: Internal Spearphishing
* ID: T1534
* Tactics: [TA0008](./)

## Introduction

Internal Spearphishing (T1534) is a targeted social engineering technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, categorized under Initial Access. Unlike general phishing, internal spearphishing specifically involves attackers sending carefully crafted, personalized phishing emails from within an organization's compromised infrastructure or email accounts. The internal origin significantly increases the likelihood of success, as recipients often trust emails from internal sources, leading to credential theft, malware deployment, or further lateral movement within the network.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Internal spearphishing leverages compromised internal email accounts or infrastructure to send spearphishing emails to other individuals within the same organization. Attackers typically follow a structured approach:

* **Initial Compromise:** Attackers first gain access to an internal email account or mail server through techniques such as credential theft, phishing, password spraying, brute forcing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
* **Reconnaissance:** After gaining initial access, attackers conduct reconnaissance to identify high-value targets, organizational structure, and communication patterns. They may review email histories, organizational charts, or internal documentation to craft believable emails.
* **Crafting Emails:** Attackers carefully design emails that closely mimic legitimate internal communications, often referencing ongoing projects, internal policies, or familiar colleagues. Emails may contain:
  * Malicious attachments (e.g., weaponized Office documents, PDFs).
  * Malicious links leading to credential harvesting sites or malware downloads.
  * Requests for sensitive information or credentials under the guise of internal procedures.
* **Delivery and Execution:** Attackers send emails from compromised internal accounts, significantly increasing credibility. Recipients, assuming legitimacy, open attachments, click links, or disclose sensitive information, enabling attackers to:
  * Deploy malware payloads (RATs, ransomware, keyloggers).
  * Harvest credentials for lateral movement.
  * Escalate privileges or maintain persistent access.

Attackers may also manipulate email headers, spoof sender addresses, or utilize internal email relay servers to further obfuscate their activities and evade detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Internal spearphishing is typically employed in the following attack scenarios and stages:

* **Initial Access Stage:**
  * Attackers leverage internal spearphishing to expand footholds within an organization after initial compromise.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:**
  * Attackers target specific employees (IT administrators, executives, finance personnel) to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
* **Credential Harvesting:**
  * Attackers use internal spearphishing to prompt users into submitting credentials, enabling further access to sensitive resources.
* **Deployment of Malware:**
  * Internal spearphishing emails often contain malicious attachments or links for malware deployment, enabling attackers to establish persistence or exfiltrate data.
* **Business Email Compromise (BEC):**
  * Attackers impersonate internal executives or trusted individuals to request sensitive financial transactions or confidential information.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of internal spearphishing typically involves a combination of behavioral analysis, email gateway monitoring, and endpoint security measures:

* **Email Gateway and Filtering Solutions:**
  * Monitoring internal email traffic for anomalies, such as unusual sender-recipient combinations, unexpected attachments, or suspicious links.
  * Implementing email authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to detect spoofed internal emails.
* **Behavioral Analytics and Machine Learning:**
  * Analyzing email communication patterns to identify unusual sender behavior or deviations from normal communication flows.
  * Detecting abnormal attachment types or unexpected file formats in internal communications.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * Monitoring endpoints for suspicious processes, file creations, or execution of macros and scripts initiated from email attachments.
  * Identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with known malware payloads or command-and-control (C2) communications.
* **Network Monitoring and IDS/IPS:**
  * Detecting outbound connections to malicious domains or IP addresses triggered by malicious attachments or links.
  * Monitoring DNS queries and HTTP(S) traffic for known malicious indicators.
* **User Reporting and Awareness Training:**
  * Encouraging employees to report suspicious emails, particularly unexpected internal communications requesting sensitive information or actions.

Common Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

* Suspicious email headers or metadata inconsistencies.
* Emails containing unexpected or unusual attachments (.exe, .js, macro-enabled Office documents).
* Emails prompting immediate action or unusual requests (credential submission, financial transfers).
* Malicious URLs or domains embedded in email content.
* Unusual logins or email sending activities from internal email accounts.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting internal spearphishing is critical due to the significant potential impacts on organizational security, operations, and reputation:

* **Credential Theft and Account Compromise:**
  * Attackers can harvest credentials, enabling further unauthorized access, lateral movement, and privilege escalation within the network.
* **Malware Deployment and Persistence:**
  * Internal spearphishing can lead to malware infections, including ransomware, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and keyloggers, compromising endpoint security and data integrity.
* **Financial Losses and Fraudulent Transactions:**
  * Attackers may impersonate trusted executives or finance personnel, leading to fraudulent financial transfers (Business Email Compromise).
* **Data Exfiltration and Intellectual Property Theft:**
  * Attackers can leverage internal spearphishing to gain access to sensitive data, intellectual property, or confidential business information, resulting in competitive disadvantage and regulatory penalties.
* **Operational Disruption and Downtime:**
  * Malware infections or unauthorized access resulting from internal spearphishing can disrupt critical business operations, causing downtime and productivity loss.
* **Reputational Damage and Regulatory Consequences:**
  * Failure to detect and respond promptly can lead to public disclosure of breaches, loss of customer trust, legal liabilities, and regulatory fines.

Early detection and rapid response significantly reduce the scope, impact, and costs associated with internal spearphishing attacks.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating internal spearphishing attacks, tools employed, and resulting impacts:

* **Twitter Internal Spearphishing Incident (2020):**
  * Attackers gained initial access through social engineering tactics, compromising internal employee accounts.
  * Leveraged internal spearphishing to target other Twitter employees, eventually accessing internal administrative tools.
  * Impact: Attackers hijacked high-profile Twitter accounts (Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Apple), conducting cryptocurrency scams, causing reputational damage and financial losses.
* **Operation Aurora (Google, 2010):**
  * Attackers compromised internal email accounts to send targeted spearphishing emails to Google employees.
  * Emails contained malicious links leading to malware payloads exploiting browser vulnerabilities.
  * Impact: Intellectual property theft, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and widespread compromise of Google infrastructure.
* **RSA Security Breach (2011):**
  * Attackers sent internal spearphishing emails to RSA employees containing malicious Excel spreadsheet attachments.
  * Employees opened attachments, executing malware exploiting Adobe Flash vulnerabilities.
  * Impact: Compromise of RSA SecureID tokens, enabling subsequent attacks against RSA clients, including defense contractors.
* **Ubiquiti Networks Incident (2021):**
  * Attackers gained internal access and leveraged spearphishing tactics targeting IT administrators.
  * Emails requested sensitive credentials, enabling attackers to access cloud infrastructure and customer data.
  * Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm.

These examples illustrate the significant risks and diverse impacts associated with internal spearphishing attacks, highlighting the importance of robust detection mechanisms and employee awareness training.

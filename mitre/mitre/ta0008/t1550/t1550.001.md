# Application Access Token

## Information

* Name: Application Access Token
* ID: T1550.001
* Tactics: [TA0005](../../ta0005/), [TA0008](../)
* Technique: [T1550](./)

## Introduction

Application Access Token \[T1550.001] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under the broader Use Alternate Authentication Material technique (T1550). This sub-technique specifically refers to adversaries leveraging stolen or compromised application access tokens to authenticate and gain unauthorized access to cloud-based or web-based services. Application access tokens can grant attackers persistent, privileged access without requiring traditional user credentials, making them particularly valuable targets for threat actors.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Application access tokens are typically JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth tokens, or API keys issued by cloud or web applications to authorize access to resources without requiring repeated user authentication. These tokens often have prolonged validity periods and can be scoped with varying levels of permissions, ranging from read-only to full administrative access.

The technical execution of this sub-technique involves several key steps:

* **Token Acquisition:**
  * Attackers may acquire tokens through:
    * Phishing or social engineering attacks targeting legitimate users.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or APIs to extract tokens.
    * Compromising endpoint devices or servers where tokens are stored in plaintext or insecurely cached.
    * Intercepting tokens via network sniffing or man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
* **Token Usage:**
  * Once acquired, attackers can leverage tokens via:
    * Direct API calls to cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
    * Accessing sensitive databases, storage buckets, or internal resources.
    * Modifying or exfiltrating data silently without triggering traditional authentication alerts.
    * Establishing persistence by generating additional tokens or credentials.
* **Token Management and Persistence:**
  * Attackers may attempt to extend token lifespans or generate new tokens to maintain prolonged access.
  * Tokens may be rotated to evade detection, leveraging legitimate token renewal mechanisms.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique typically appears across multiple stages of cyber-attacks, including initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Common scenarios include:

* **Initial Access:**
  * Attackers exploit vulnerable applications or APIs to directly acquire tokens.
  * Phishing attacks that trick users into providing tokens or granting malicious OAuth apps access.
* **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers use tokens to maintain persistent access, bypassing traditional credential-based authentication.
  * Tokens with elevated privileges enable attackers to escalate their access within cloud environments.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Leveraging tokens to access additional cloud services or internal resources, facilitating lateral movement within an organization's infrastructure.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
  * Tokens provide attackers the ability to silently extract sensitive data directly from cloud storage, databases, or other resources without raising immediate suspicion.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of unauthorized use of application access tokens involves multiple approaches and mechanisms:

* **Monitoring and Logging:**
  * Comprehensive logging of token issuance, usage, and revocation.
  * Analyzing logs for unusual token usage patterns, such as:
    * Access from unfamiliar IP addresses or geographic regions.
    * Unusual access times or frequency of API calls.
    * Unexpected token scopes or privileges.
* **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection:**
  * Implementing analytics tools to detect deviations from normal token usage patterns.
  * Alerting on suspicious token-related activities, such as:
    * Sudden spikes in API usage.
    * Access patterns inconsistent with legitimate user or application behavior.
* **Token Management and Auditing:**
  * Regular audits of active tokens and their associated privileges.
  * Automated token expiration and rotation policies to limit exposure window.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unrecognized or unauthorized API calls in cloud provider logs.
  * Suspicious OAuth or API token generation events logged in identity provider systems.
  * Presence of unusual tokens with administrative or privileged scopes.
  * Evidence of token extraction attempts from compromised endpoints or logs indicating token theft.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Timely detection of unauthorized application access token usage is critical due to the severe potential impacts on organizations:

* **Data Breaches and Exfiltration:**
  * Tokens can grant attackers direct access to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches, intellectual property theft, or privacy violations.
* **Financial and Operational Risks:**
  * Attackers leveraging tokens may incur significant financial costs through unauthorized cloud resource usage or service disruptions.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
  * Compromised tokens with elevated privileges enable attackers to escalate their access and persist undetected within the organization's infrastructure.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Implications:**
  * Unauthorized access can lead to regulatory violations, compliance issues, and associated legal and reputational consequences.

Early detection and response significantly reduce these risks, limiting attackers' opportunities to escalate privileges, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Examples

Real-world examples and scenarios involving the misuse of application access tokens include:

* **GitHub OAuth Token Abuse:**
  * Attackers have targeted GitHub OAuth tokens to gain access to private repositories, enabling theft of proprietary source code and sensitive data.
  * Attackers may trick users into granting OAuth permissions to malicious apps, obtaining tokens that provide persistent access to user repositories.
* **AWS API Key Compromise:**
  * Attackers stealing AWS API keys from compromised developer workstations or publicly exposed repositories.
  * Using compromised API keys, attackers have launched unauthorized EC2 instances, accessed sensitive S3 buckets, and exfiltrated data.
* **Microsoft Azure Token Theft:**
  * Threat actors have compromised Azure AD tokens through phishing attacks, allowing unauthorized access to Office 365 resources, SharePoint sites, and confidential email communications.
  * Attackers leveraged these tokens to perform lateral movement within Azure environments and escalate privileges by acquiring additional tokens or credentials.
* **Slack Token Misuse:**
  * Attackers have stolen Slack tokens from compromised endpoints or phishing attacks, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive internal communications, files, and integrations.
  * Attackers could leverage Slack tokens to access connected third-party services or escalate privileges within integrated systems.

These examples highlight the critical importance of securing, monitoring, and promptly detecting unauthorized use of application access tokens to mitigate potential damage and maintain organizational security posture.

# Reconnaissance

## Information

* ID: TA0043

## Introduction

Reconnaissance is a critical tactic defined within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, representing the initial stage of cyber-attacks where adversaries gather information about their intended targets. This stage involves collecting data that can aid attackers in planning subsequent phases of their operation. Reconnaissance includes activities such as scanning networks, enumerating services, identifying vulnerabilities, and profiling users or organizations. Early detection and mitigation of reconnaissance can significantly reduce the effectiveness of potential attacks by limiting attackers' understanding of the targeted environment.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Reconnaissance encompasses various techniques and methodologies attackers use to gather crucial information before launching an attack. Common execution methods include:

* **Active Scanning:**
  * Network scanning to identify live hosts, open ports, and available services (e.g., using tools such as Nmap, Masscan).
  * Web application scanning to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP).
* **Passive Information Gathering:**
  * Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection from publicly available sources (social media, forums, job postings, corporate websites).
  * DNS enumeration to discover subdomains and IP addresses (e.g., tools like dnsenum, dnsrecon, Sublist3r).
  * Scraping and analyzing metadata from publicly available documents and files.
* **Credential and User Enumeration:**
  * Enumeration of usernames, email addresses, and credentials via social engineering or data breaches.
  * Identifying valid accounts through brute-force or credential spraying techniques.
* **Infrastructure Mapping:**
  * Identifying cloud services, third-party providers, and external infrastructure through DNS lookups, SSL certificate analysis, and public cloud storage enumeration.
  * Network topology mapping to understand the internal network structure and segmentation.

Real-world procedures often involve combining multiple reconnaissance techniques to build comprehensive profiles of victims, including technical infrastructure, employee information, and security posture.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Reconnaissance is generally the first stage in almost all cyber-attacks. It appears throughout various attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Access Preparation:**
  * Attackers perform reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities and entry points before attempting network penetration.
* **Targeted Attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats (APT):**
  * Reconnaissance is a fundamental step for threat actors conducting highly targeted attacks to understand victim infrastructure, personnel, and defense mechanisms.
* **Social Engineering Campaigns:**
  * Attackers gather personal and organizational information to craft convincing phishing or spear-phishing emails.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
  * Attackers conduct reconnaissance on third-party vendors and partners to identify weaker security postures and entry points.
* **Post-Exploitation Phases:**
  * Even after initial compromise, attackers continue reconnaissance internally to discover additional systems, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of reconnaissance activities involves various methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Monitoring for anomalous network scans, excessive DNS queries, unusual port scans, and repeated failed connection attempts.
  * Tools: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like Snort, Suricata; Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions like Splunk, Elastic Security.
* **Log and Event Monitoring:**
  * Identifying unusual login attempts, failed authentication events, or access attempts to restricted resources.
  * Reviewing firewall logs for blocked connection attempts and scanning activity.
* **Honeypots and Deception Technologies:**
  * Deploying honeypots or deception systems to detect and analyze reconnaissance attempts.
  * Tools: Modern deception platforms (e.g., Thinkst Canary, Attivo Networks).
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * Monitoring endpoint activities for suspicious behavior indicative of reconnaissance tools or scripts execution.
* **IoCs and Behavioral Indicators:**
  * Known reconnaissance tools signatures (e.g., Nmap user-agent strings, Masscan scanning patterns).
  * Behavioral anomalies such as high volumes of DNS enumeration requests or repeated attempts to access non-existent resources.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting reconnaissance activities early is crucial due to the following potential impacts and considerations:

* **Preventing Further Attack Stages:**
  * Early detection can disrupt attackers' planning phases, limiting their ability to exploit vulnerabilities and reducing overall attack success.
* **Reducing Attack Surface Exposure:**
  * Identifying reconnaissance attempts helps organizations proactively patch vulnerabilities, secure exposed services, and strengthen defenses.
* **Mitigating Data Breaches and Operational Disruption:**
  * Early detection limits attackers' ability to escalate privileges, move laterally, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
* **Improving Incident Response Effectiveness:**
  * Early awareness enables security teams to prepare and respond effectively, reducing the overall impact and cost of cyber incidents.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:**
  * Detection and response to reconnaissance activities are often required by regulatory frameworks and industry standards to ensure adequate cybersecurity measures.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating reconnaissance activities and their impacts include:

* **Equifax Breach (2017):**
  * Attackers conducted extensive reconnaissance, including vulnerability scanning, to identify an Apache Struts vulnerability, ultimately leading to the compromise of personal data for millions of users.
  * Tools used: Network scanning tools, automated vulnerability scanners.
  * Impact: Massive data breach affecting approximately 147 million customers, significant financial losses, and reputational damage.
* **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020):**
  * Attackers performed reconnaissance on SolarWinds' software development and update infrastructure, identifying weaknesses to insert malicious code into software updates.
  * Tools used: Custom malware, passive reconnaissance techniques, infrastructure enumeration.
  * Impact: Compromise of multiple U.S. government agencies and private-sector organizations, extensive data exfiltration, and long-term espionage operations.
* **Operation Aurora (2009-2010):**
  * Chinese threat actors conducted targeted reconnaissance against Google and other technology companies, identifying vulnerable systems through extensive scanning and enumeration.
  * Tools used: Custom scanning scripts, targeted phishing emails informed by reconnaissance findings.
  * Impact: Intellectual property theft, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and significant changes in cybersecurity practices within affected companies.
* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Phishing Campaigns:**
  * Extensive reconnaissance on targeted individuals and organizations to craft highly tailored spear-phishing emails.
  * Tools used: OSINT gathering, credential enumeration, social media monitoring.
  * Impact: Successful compromise of email accounts, espionage activities, and sensitive information theft.

These examples illustrate the diversity of reconnaissance techniques, the range of tools utilized, and the significant consequences when reconnaissance activities are not detected and mitigated early.

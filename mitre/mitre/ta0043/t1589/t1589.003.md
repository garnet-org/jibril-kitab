# Employee Names

## Information

* Name: Employee Names
* ID: T1589.003
* Tactics: [TA0043](../)
* Technique: [T1589](./)

## Introduction

Employee Names (T1589.003) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader category of reconnaissance (T1589). Attackers leverage this sub-technique to gather employee-specific information, including names, roles, organizational hierarchy, and contact details. This information is typically used to facilitate subsequent stages of cyber-attacks, such as social engineering, spear phishing, or impersonation attacks. Employee names and associated details can be sourced from publicly available resources, social media platforms, official company websites, and leaked databases.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers using Employee Names (T1589.003) typically follow a structured approach to gather detailed employee information:

* **Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering:**
  * Attackers utilize publicly accessible sources such as corporate websites, online directories, LinkedIn profiles, and other professional networking platforms.
  * Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are also leveraged to identify employees and their roles within organizations.
* **Automated Scraping and Enumeration:**
  * Automated tools and scripts, such as LinkedIn scrapers or custom web crawlers, may be employed to systematically gather large volumes of employee data.
  * Enumeration of email addresses based on naming conventions (e.g., [firstname.lastname@company.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@company.com)) is common, and automated tools like Hunter.io, TheHarvester, or LinkedInt can facilitate this process.
* **Data Breach and Leak Exploitation:**
  * Attackers may search through publicly available data breaches, dark web marketplaces, or leaked databases to obtain employee names and associated details.
  * Platforms such as Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), Pastebin, and other leak-sharing sites can provide attackers with valuable information.
* **Social Engineering and Direct Interaction:**
  * Attackers may directly interact with employees via phone calls, emails, or social media messages, posing as recruiters, colleagues, or partners to extract additional organizational information.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique is commonly employed during the reconnaissance phase of an attack lifecycle. Specifically, attackers often leverage Employee Names (T1589.003) in the following scenarios:

* **Pre-Attack Reconnaissance:**
  * Attackers collect employee names and roles to map organizational structure, identify key personnel, and understand internal hierarchies.
  * This information helps attackers select appropriate targets for spear phishing, business email compromise (BEC) attacks, or impersonation attempts.
* **Social Engineering Attacks:**
  * Employee names and details are critical when crafting convincing phishing emails, vishing (voice phishing) calls, or smishing (SMS phishing) messages.
  * Attackers impersonate known employees or executives to gain trust and increase the likelihood of successful exploitation.
* **Credential Harvesting and Account Takeovers:**
  * Attackers use employee information to guess usernames, email addresses, and passwords, facilitating credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.
  * Employee names help attackers create targeted password lists or dictionaries based on common naming conventions.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Campaigns:**
  * Nation-state adversaries and advanced persistent threat groups frequently use employee information for prolonged reconnaissance and targeted intrusion campaigns.
  * Employee data supports initial access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within an organization.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Organizations can detect the usage of Employee Names (T1589.003) through various methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Monitoring and Detection Methods:**
  * Monitor web server logs and network traffic for unusual scraping or enumeration patterns.
  * Track and analyze repeated failed login attempts or enumeration activities against corporate email systems or Active Directory.
  * Implement honeytokens or fake employee profiles on public websites or directories to detect scraping attempts.
* **Security Tools and Technologies:**
  * Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) configured to detect and block automated scraping attempts.
  * Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) with rules to identify enumeration or reconnaissance attempts.
  * Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions that detect anomalous user account activity or credential stuffing attempts.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual spikes in web traffic from a single IP address or user-agent, indicative of automated scraping.
  * Multiple enumeration attempts against employee email addresses or login portals.
  * Suspicious social engineering attempts reported by employees, including unsolicited contact requesting sensitive organizational information.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Employee Names (T1589.003) reconnaissance activities is critical due to the significant impact this information can have on organizational security posture:

* **Preventing Social Engineering Attacks:**
  * Employee information is a critical component in spear phishing and social engineering attacks. Early detection helps organizations proactively inform and train employees, reducing the likelihood of successful exploitation.
* **Protecting Against Credential-Based Attacks:**
  * Attackers use employee names and email addresses to perform credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or account takeovers. Early detection can mitigate these threats before they escalate into successful compromises.
* **Reducing Risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC):**
  * Employee names, roles, and organizational hierarchy details are leveraged in BEC attacks, resulting in financial losses or sensitive data leaks. Detecting reconnaissance activities early reduces the risk of successful BEC attacks.
* **Minimizing Damage from Targeted Attacks and APTs:**
  * Nation-state adversaries and advanced attackers use employee information to stage targeted attacks. Early detection allows organizations to enhance defenses, implement targeted monitoring, and respond proactively to potential threats.
* **Protecting Organizational Reputation:**
  * Detecting and preventing employee information reconnaissance reduces the risk of successful cyber-attacks and data breaches, thereby protecting the organization's reputation, customer trust, and regulatory compliance posture.

## Examples

Real-world examples showcasing the use of Employee Names (T1589.003) in cyber-attacks include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Campaigns:**
  * Russian state-sponsored threat group APT29 has been known to leverage employee information gathered through OSINT and phishing attacks to target government agencies and private sector organizations.
  * Attackers used publicly available employee names and email addresses to craft convincing spear phishing emails designed to compromise credentials and gain initial access.
* **FIN7 Financial Sector Attacks:**
  * Cybercriminal group FIN7 extensively utilized employee names and roles to craft targeted phishing emails aimed at financial institutions, retail, and hospitality sectors.
  * Leveraging employee-specific details increased the likelihood of successful phishing and credential harvesting, resulting in significant financial losses.
* **LinkedIn Scraping Incident (2021):**
  * Attackers scraped publicly available employee names, job titles, and company affiliations from LinkedIn, resulting in a large dataset of employee information made available for sale on dark web forums.
  * The scraped data was subsequently used for targeted phishing campaigns, credential stuffing attacks, and social engineering attempts against affected organizations.
* **Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scenarios:**
  * Attackers frequently use publicly available employee names and roles to impersonate executives or finance personnel in BEC attacks.
  * Successful BEC attacks leveraging employee details have led to significant financial losses and reputational damage for affected organizations.

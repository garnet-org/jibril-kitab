# Purchase Technical Data

## Information

* Name: Purchase Technical Data
* ID: T1597.002
* Tactics: [TA0043](../)
* Technique: [T1597](./)

## Introduction

Purchase Technical Data (T1597.002) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader technique of Gather Victim Information (T1597). In this specific sub-technique, adversaries purchase or otherwise acquire technical documentation, specifications, manuals, or other detailed technical data about targeted systems or components. This information can aid attackers in planning and executing subsequent cyber operations, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and persistence.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries leveraging this sub-technique typically acquire technical data through legitimate or semi-legitimate channels, such as:

* Online marketplaces or forums where technical documentation is sold or exchanged
* Dark web marketplaces offering stolen or leaked proprietary data
* Vendors or third-party resellers of technical manuals, blueprints, or system specifications
* Insider threats or compromised employees selling confidential information

Technical data sought by adversaries may include:

* System architecture diagrams
* Network topology and configuration documents
* Hardware specifications and schematics
* Software documentation, manuals, and source code
* Firmware details and configuration guidelines
* Maintenance and operational procedures

Once obtained, attackers analyze the purchased technical data to:

* Identify vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in targeted systems
* Develop customized exploits or payloads tailored specifically for the targeted environment
* Understand operational procedures to evade detection and maintain persistence
* Improve social engineering campaigns by leveraging detailed system knowledge
* Enhance effectiveness of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration activities

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique can appear across multiple stages of cyber-attacks, particularly during reconnaissance and initial access phases. Common scenarios include:

* Early-stage reconnaissance, where attackers seek detailed technical data before initiating intrusion attempts
* Targeted cyber-espionage campaigns, where adversaries require precise knowledge of victim infrastructure or proprietary technologies
* Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) aiming to maintain long-term stealth and persistence by deeply understanding victim networks
* Supply chain attacks, where attackers acquire technical data to exploit vulnerabilities within third-party vendors or partners
* Preparation for sophisticated ransomware or sabotage operations, where detailed system knowledge is essential for maximum impact

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of adversaries purchasing technical data is challenging because the acquisition often occurs outside the targeted organization's direct visibility. However, organizations can detect indirect signs and indicators through:

* Monitoring dark web marketplaces and forums for unauthorized sales or mentions of proprietary or sensitive technical documents
* Employing threat intelligence services that track illicit marketplaces and alert organizations when relevant technical data surfaces
* Implementing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems and insider threat monitoring to detect unauthorized transfers or access of sensitive technical documentation
* Conducting regular audits and anomaly detection for unusual access patterns or requests for technical data within internal networks
* Monitoring email and network traffic for suspicious communications involving technical data exchanges with external entities

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) may include:

* Discovery of proprietary technical documents on unauthorized external sites or forums
* Alerts from threat intelligence feeds regarding leaked or sold technical manuals, schematics, or documentation
* Unusual employee activities related to accessing, downloading, or transferring sensitive technical data
* Reports from third-party vendors or partners regarding compromised or leaked technical information

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting adversaries purchasing technical data is critical due to the following potential impacts:

* Enhanced Reconnaissance Capability: Attackers armed with detailed technical information can launch highly targeted and sophisticated attacks, significantly increasing the probability of successful exploitation.
* Improved Exploit Development: Technical data allows adversaries to craft customized exploits or malware tailored specifically to victim infrastructure, increasing the effectiveness and reducing detection likelihood.
* Increased Risk of Persistence: Attackers with detailed knowledge of system configurations and operational procedures can better evade detection and establish persistent footholds within the victim's environment.
* Heightened Risk of Operational Disruption: Accurate technical data enables attackers to disrupt critical systems more effectively, potentially causing significant downtime, financial losses, or reputational damage.
* Elevated Insider Threat Risk: Unauthorized sales or leaks of technical data may indicate insider threats, highlighting underlying organizational vulnerabilities or compromised personnel.

Early detection allows organizations to:

* Mitigate potential attacks proactively by patching vulnerabilities identified through leaked technical data
* Strengthen security posture and response planning by understanding attacker motivations and targets
* Reduce potential financial, operational, and reputational impacts through timely response and remediation
* Initiate internal investigations and corrective measures to prevent further unauthorized disclosures or insider threats

## Examples

* **APT10 (MenuPass)**:
  * Attack Scenario: APT10, a Chinese threat actor, has been known to purchase or acquire sensitive technical documentation to facilitate targeted cyber espionage operations.
  * Tools and Methods: Acquired technical data related to cloud service providers and managed service providers (MSPs) to perform targeted spear-phishing and supply chain compromises.
  * Impact: Successfully compromised multiple global MSPs, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive client data and intellectual property theft.
* **Dark Web Technical Data Sales**:
  * Attack Scenario: Cybercriminal forums regularly offer stolen or leaked technical documents, including internal network diagrams, system manuals, and proprietary software documentation.
  * Tools and Methods: Attackers purchase these documents to identify vulnerabilities and develop targeted exploits or ransomware payloads.
  * Impact: Numerous ransomware attacks and targeted intrusions have been traced back to technical data initially obtained from dark web marketplaces, resulting in significant operational disruption and financial losses to victim organizations.
* **Insider Threat Incident at Aerospace Company**:
  * Attack Scenario: An employee at a major aerospace manufacturer sold proprietary technical schematics and manuals online.
  * Tools and Methods: Attackers purchased this data to gain detailed insights into critical aerospace systems, facilitating targeted espionage campaigns.
  * Impact: Loss of sensitive intellectual property, heightened risk of espionage, and significant reputational damage for the affected organization.

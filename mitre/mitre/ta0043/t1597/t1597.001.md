## Information

* Name: Threat Intel Vendors
* ID: T1597.001
* Tactics: [TA0043](../)
* Technique: [T1597](./)

## Introduction

Threat Intel Vendors ([T1597.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1597/001/)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader category of "Search Victim's Publicly Available Information." This technique involves adversaries leveraging threat intelligence services and vendors to gather information about targeted organizations, their security posture, vulnerabilities, and potential points of entry. By using commercially available or open-source threat intelligence platforms, attackers gain valuable insights into defensive measures, security awareness, and vulnerabilities that can later be exploited in targeted attacks.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries employing Threat Intel Vendors (T1597.001) capitalize on publicly accessible threat intelligence services and platforms, including commercial, open-source, or subscription-based providers. Threat intelligence vendors typically aggregate and analyze data related to cyber threats, vulnerabilities, exploits, and emerging attack methods. Attackers exploit this information to perform reconnaissance, plan attacks, and identify potential vulnerabilities in targeted organizations.

Key mechanisms and execution methods include:

* **Subscription to Commercial Threat Intelligence Feeds**:
  * Attackers may subscribe to paid services to obtain detailed vulnerability reports, security posture assessments, and threat landscape analyses.
  * Commercial providers often deliver comprehensive vulnerability intelligence, including CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) details, exploit availability, and affected software versions.
* **Open-Source Threat Intelligence Platforms**:
  * Platforms such as AlienVault OTX, MISP, VirusTotal, Shodan, and GreyNoise provide freely accessible threat data, IoCs, and vulnerability information.
  * Attackers utilize these platforms to obtain reconnaissance data on targeted organizations, including exposed services, security misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities.
* **Leveraging Security Vendor Reports and Blogs**:
  * Attackers closely monitor security vendor publications, blogs, and threat advisories to identify newly discovered vulnerabilities, zero-day exploits, and attack techniques.
  * Vendor reports often detail affected software versions, exploitation methods, and defensive recommendations, which can be reverse-engineered by attackers to formulate targeted exploits.
* **Analyzing Public Threat Intel Reports and Advisories**:
  * Publicly available advisories from CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams), vulnerability disclosures, and security community forums provide attackers with timely and actionable intelligence.
  * Attackers use this information to prioritize targets, plan attack strategies, and identify opportunities for exploitation.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Adversaries typically employ Threat Intel Vendors (T1597.001) during early reconnaissance phases of the cyber kill chain, specifically:

* **Initial Reconnaissance and Target Selection**:
  * Gathering detailed intelligence about target organizations, their infrastructure, and security posture.
  * Identifying potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposed services.
* **Weaponization and Exploit Development**:
  * Leveraging intelligence from threat vendors to develop targeted exploits, malware payloads, and phishing campaigns tailored to identified vulnerabilities.
  * Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on exploit availability, criticality, and ease of exploitation.
* **Pre-Attack Planning and Preparation**:
  * Understanding target defenses and security maturity to better plan attack methods, timing, and operational security (OPSEC) measures.
  * Identifying security tools and defensive mechanisms employed by the target organization to evade detection and improve attack success rates.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of adversaries utilizing Threat Intel Vendors (T1597.001) is challenging as it involves passive reconnaissance activities that typically occur externally. However, organizations can employ several methods and tools to detect or infer such activity:

* **Monitoring for Reconnaissance Activities**:
  * Implementing threat intelligence monitoring platforms to detect unusual or suspicious queries against organizational assets in publicly accessible threat intelligence services.
  * Using honeypots or decoy systems to detect reconnaissance activities and track adversary interest.
* **Analyzing Web and Network Traffic Logs**:
  * Identifying unusual patterns of traffic originating from known threat intelligence platforms, scanners, or IP addresses associated with reconnaissance activity.
  * Leveraging security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to correlate and analyze logs for reconnaissance attempts.
* **Threat Intelligence and Dark Web Monitoring**:
  * Employing threat intelligence services to monitor dark web forums, marketplaces, and hacker communities for indicators of adversary interest or reconnaissance activity targeting the organization.
  * Detecting mentions, discussions, or queries related to the organization's infrastructure, vulnerabilities, or security posture.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Known IP addresses or domains associated with reconnaissance services (Shodan, GreyNoise, Censys).
  * User-agent strings, headers, or query patterns characteristic of automated reconnaissance tools or threat intelligence platforms.
  * Repeated scanning, probing, or querying activities against organizational assets.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting adversaries leveraging Threat Intel Vendors (T1597.001) is critical due to the potential impacts and risks associated with early reconnaissance activities:

* **Early Warning and Proactive Defense**:
  * Identifying reconnaissance attempts provides early warning signals, enabling organizations to proactively strengthen defenses, patch vulnerabilities, and mitigate risks before exploitation occurs.
* **Reducing Attack Surface Exposure**:
  * Detection allows organizations to identify and remediate exposed services, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities that attackers discover through threat intelligence services.
  * Proactive remediation reduces the organization's attack surface and limits opportunities for exploitation.
* **Improved Security Posture and Awareness**:
  * Ongoing detection and monitoring of reconnaissance activities enhance organizational security awareness, response readiness, and resilience against targeted attacks.
  * Understanding adversary reconnaissance methods helps security teams prioritize defensive resources and implement effective countermeasures.
* **Minimizing Risk of Successful Exploitation**:
  * Early detection and remediation of vulnerabilities identified through adversary reconnaissance significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation and compromise.
  * Preventing attackers from leveraging threat intelligence data limits their ability to execute targeted attacks effectively.

## Examples

Real-world examples of adversaries using Threat Intel Vendors (T1597.001) include:

* **APT Groups Leveraging Shodan and Censys**:
  * Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors frequently utilize platforms like Shodan and Censys to identify publicly exposed services, misconfigured servers, and vulnerable infrastructure.
  * Attackers use gathered intelligence to target vulnerable systems, deploy malware, and establish persistent footholds within targeted organizations.
* **Use of VirusTotal by Attackers**:
  * Adversaries upload malware samples to VirusTotal to test detection rates and modify payloads accordingly, ensuring lower detection rates before deployment.
  * Attackers also query VirusTotal to identify antivirus engines used by targeted organizations, tailoring their malware to evade specific detection mechanisms.
* **Exploitation of Commercial Threat Intelligence Feeds**:
  * Cybercriminal groups have subscribed to commercial threat intelligence feeds to gain early access to vulnerability reports, exploit availability, and affected software versions.
  * Attackers rapidly weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities, leveraging detailed intelligence to execute targeted ransomware attacks and data breaches.
* **Monitoring Security Vendor Blogs and Advisories**:
  * Attackers routinely monitor security vendor publications, blogs, and advisories to identify newly disclosed vulnerabilities (such as ProxyLogon, Log4Shell, or MOVEit Transfer vulnerabilities).
  * Utilizing this intelligence, attackers quickly develop exploits and launch widespread attacks against organizations that have not yet applied patches or mitigations.
* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Utilizing Open-Source Intelligence Platforms**:
  * APT29 has historically leveraged open-source threat intelligence platforms and publicly available security reports to gather intelligence on targeted organizations, their defensive measures, and vulnerabilities.
  * Intelligence gathered through these platforms enabled APT29 to conduct highly targeted spear-phishing campaigns, malware deployment, and espionage operations, significantly impacting targeted organizations.

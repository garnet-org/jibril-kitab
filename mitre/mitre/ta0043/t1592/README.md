# Gather Victim Host Information

## Information

* Name: Gather Victim Host Information
* ID: T1592
* Tactics: [TA0043](../)
* Sub-Technique: [T1592.001](t1592.001.md), [T1592.004](t1592.004.md), [T1592.003](t1592.003.md), [T1592.002](t1592.002.md)

## Introduction

Gathering victim host information is a critical tactic categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework as technique T1592. It involves adversaries systematically collecting detailed information about the compromised system, including operating system details, hardware configuration, network interfaces, installed software, and user accounts. This reconnaissance enables attackers to understand the victim environment better, escalate privileges, move laterally, and tailor subsequent attack stages effectively.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers employ various methods and tools to gather detailed host information from compromised systems. Typical execution methods include:

* **System Commands and Utilities:**
  * Windows-based commands:
    * `systeminfo` – retrieves detailed OS and hardware information.
    * `ipconfig /all` – enumerates network interface details.
    * `net user`, `net localgroup administrators` – lists user accounts and privileges.
    * `tasklist`, `tasklist /svc` – shows running processes and associated services.
  * Linux-based commands:
    * `uname -a` – kernel and OS version.
    * `ifconfig`, `ip addr` – network interface and IP information.
    * `cat /etc/passwd`, `cat /etc/group` – user and group information.
    * `ps aux`, `top` – running processes and resource utilization.
* **Scripting and Automation:**
  * PowerShell scripts:
    * Leverage cmdlets like `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Get-NetIPAddress`, and `Get-WmiObject` to automate system enumeration.
  * Bash/Python scripts:
    * Automate the execution of multiple commands and compile results into structured formats for easier analysis.
* **Malicious or Legitimate Third-party Tools:**
  * Sysinternals Suite (e.g., PsInfo, PsLoggedOn).
  * Custom enumeration scripts (e.g., LinEnum, WinPEAS).
  * Remote administration tools (RATs) with built-in enumeration capabilities.

Real-world procedures typically involve attackers initially gaining a foothold through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or remote code execution, followed by extensive enumeration to map the victim environment for further exploitation.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Gathering victim host information occurs at multiple stages throughout the attack lifecycle, including:

* **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
  * Immediately after initial compromise to understand the victim environment.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Identifying vulnerable software versions, misconfigured permissions, or sensitive files that enable privilege escalation.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Enumerating network interfaces, routing tables, and connected hosts to identify potential lateral movement targets.
* **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
  * Understanding installed security software and processes to evade detection and establish persistence.
* **Exfiltration Preparation:**
  * Identifying valuable information, data storage locations, and network paths to plan efficient data exfiltration.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of host information gathering typically involves a combination of endpoint monitoring, logging, and behavioral analytics tools:

* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * Monitors execution of enumeration commands and abnormal script execution.
  * Detects unusual process spawning and suspicious command-line parameters.
* **System and Security Event Logging:**
  * Windows Event Logs (e.g., Security, Sysmon):
    * Event ID 4688 – Process Creation events.
    * Event ID 7045 – Service installation events.
  * Linux auditd logs:
    * Monitoring command executions and file access events.
* **Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**
  * Detect network scanning and enumeration traffic originating from compromised hosts.
  * Identify unusual DNS queries or outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration or enumeration activities.
* **Behavioral Analytics and SIEM Solutions:**
  * Machine learning and rule-based alerting on anomalous enumeration behavior.
  * Correlation of multiple suspicious enumeration events across hosts.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

* Execution of enumeration commands like `systeminfo`, `ipconfig`, `net user`, `uname`, `ifconfig`.
* High-frequency or scripted enumeration commands executed in quick succession.
* Suspicious file creations or script executions in temporary directories (e.g., `%TEMP%`, `/tmp`).
* Unexpected network connections or DNS requests associated with enumeration tools or scripts.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of victim host information gathering is critical due to several potential impacts on systems and networks:

* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers use gathered information to identify vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that allow privilege escalation.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Detailed host enumeration helps attackers identify additional targets within the network, enabling lateral movement.
* **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
  * Understanding installed security tools and system configurations allows attackers to evade detection and establish persistent footholds.
* **Data Exfiltration and Loss:**
  * Attackers use host information to locate sensitive data, resulting in potential data breaches and intellectual property theft.
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Enumeration activities may precede disruptive attacks such as ransomware deployment, system sabotage, or denial of service.

Detecting this technique early significantly reduces attacker dwell time, limits lateral movement opportunities, and prevents further compromise or data loss.

## Examples

Real-world examples of victim host information gathering include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**
  * Utilized PowerShell scripts extensively to enumerate Windows hosts, gather system information, and identify security software installations during the SolarWinds supply chain compromise.
  * Impact: Allowed deep penetration into victim networks, resulting in long-term espionage operations.
* **FIN7 Cybercrime Group:**
  * Leveraged built-in Windows commands (`systeminfo`, `tasklist`) and custom scripts to enumerate infected hosts, identify payment systems, and escalate privileges.
  * Impact: Enabled targeted financial data theft and significant monetary loss for affected organizations.
* **Emotet Malware:**
  * After initial infection, Emotet performed extensive host enumeration, gathering information on installed software, processes, and network topology.
  * Impact: Facilitated subsequent deployment of secondary payloads like TrickBot and Ryuk ransomware, resulting in severe operational disruptions and financial damages.
* **Conti Ransomware:**
  * Utilized enumeration tools and scripts (e.g., WinPEAS, LinPEAS) to gather host information and identify privilege escalation opportunities.
  * Impact: Enabled rapid lateral movement and ransomware deployment, causing significant operational downtime and financial losses.

These examples illustrate the broad usage of host information gathering across various threat actors and attack scenarios, highlighting its critical role in successful cyberattacks.

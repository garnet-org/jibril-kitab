# Firmware

## Information

* Name: Firmware
* ID: T1592.003
* Tactics: [TA0043](../)
* Technique: [T1592](./)

## Introduction

Firmware manipulation, identified as sub-technique T1592.003 in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, involves adversaries compromising or altering firmware within devices or systems to establish persistence, evade detection, or cause disruption. Firmware is low-level software embedded in hardware components, controlling their basic functions, and is typically executed before operating systems or higher-level software. Due to its privileged position and difficulty to inspect or remediate, firmware has become a prime target for sophisticated threat actors seeking stealthy, persistent access.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Firmware compromise can occur through several methods, each requiring varying levels of access and sophistication:

* **Firmware Modification**: Attackers alter legitimate firmware images or binaries, injecting malicious code to achieve persistence, evade traditional security controls, or disable security mechanisms.
* **Firmware Replacement**: Complete replacement of legitimate firmware with maliciously-crafted firmware, often using compromised supply chains, physical access, or remote exploitation of update mechanisms.
* **Firmware Backdoors**: Implanting hidden backdoors within firmware to allow persistent access, data exfiltration, or command-and-control (C2) communication, typically undetectable by standard security tools.
* **Firmware Corruption or Bricking**: Intentional corruption of firmware to render devices unusable (bricking), causing denial-of-service conditions or operational disruptions.

Technical mechanisms attackers leverage include:

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in firmware update mechanisms (e.g., insecure bootloaders, unsigned firmware updates, weak cryptographic signatures).
* Leveraging compromised hardware supply chains to embed malicious firmware at manufacturing or distribution stages.
* Utilizing specialized tools, such as firmware extraction and modification utilities, reverse engineering frameworks, and bootkit/rootkit techniques to embed malicious functionality.

Real-world procedures often involve:

* Initial compromise through phishing, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or insider threats.
* Escalation of privileges to firmware-level access, often requiring kernel-level or physical access.
* Persistence through firmware implants, surviving OS reinstallation, system resets, or hard disk replacements.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Firmware attacks typically appear during advanced, persistent, or targeted attacks, especially in scenarios such as:

* **Espionage and Persistent Access**: Nation-state actors aiming for long-term, stealthy persistence in sensitive networks and critical infrastructure.
* **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromise of firmware during manufacturing, distribution, or updates, affecting large-scale deployments.
* **Sabotage and Operational Disruption**: Intentional firmware corruption or bricking to disable critical systems, infrastructure, or industrial control systems (ICS).
* **High-value Target Compromise**: Targeting critical infrastructure, military systems, telecommunications equipment, or industrial control devices, where firmware-level compromise provides maximum stealth and persistence.
* **Evasion of Security Controls**: Circumventing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems by embedding malicious code below the OS layer.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting firmware compromise is challenging but possible through specialized methods and tools:

* **Firmware Integrity Verification**:
  * Cryptographic signature verification against known good firmware images.
  * Regular checksum and hash comparisons to detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Behavioral Monitoring**:
  * Monitoring unusual hardware-level behavior or anomalous device performance.
  * Detecting unexpected reboots, boot sequence anomalies, or device instability.
* **Hardware and Firmware Security Solutions**:
  * Use of hardware root-of-trust modules (e.g., Trusted Platform Module - TPM) to verify firmware integrity during boot.
  * Firmware-level anomaly detection tools and specialized firmware security scanners.
* **Network-Based Indicators**:
  * Detecting unusual outbound traffic patterns or C2 communications originating from firmware implants.
  * Monitoring for unexpected firmware update downloads or unauthorized firmware update attempts.
* **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Unrecognized firmware version numbers or mismatched firmware images.
  * Presence of unauthorized or unknown firmware update logs.
  * Unexpected system behaviors such as persistent device malfunctions, unexplained crashes, or boot issues.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting firmware compromise early is critical due to the severe potential impacts:

* **Persistent and Stealthy Access**: Firmware-level implants survive OS reinstalls, disk replacements, and standard remediation efforts, allowing attackers long-term persistence.
* **High Privilege and Control**: Firmware operates at the lowest software level, providing attackers complete control over hardware behavior, including disabling security features, exfiltrating sensitive data, and disrupting system operations.
* **Difficulty of Remediation**: Once compromised, firmware is challenging to remediate, often requiring hardware replacement or specialized reflashing procedures.
* **Operational and Financial Impact**: Firmware compromise can lead to severe disruptions, downtime, costly hardware replacements, or extensive forensic investigations.
* **Increased Risk to Critical Infrastructure**: Firmware attacks against critical infrastructure, ICS, or military systems can result in catastrophic operational failures, safety risks, or national security threats.

## Examples

Real-world examples of firmware compromise include:

* **LoJax UEFI Rootkit (APT28)**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Russian-linked APT28 (Fancy Bear) compromised Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware to implant a persistent backdoor.
  * **Tools Used**: LoJax rootkit, leveraging vulnerabilities in UEFI firmware to implant malicious code.
  * **Impacts**: Persistent access, evasion of traditional security tools, requiring firmware reflashing or hardware replacement to remediate.
* **ShadowHammer Supply Chain Attack (Operation ShadowHammer)**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Attackers compromised ASUS firmware update servers to distribute malicious firmware updates to thousands of ASUS devices.
  * **Tools Used**: Malicious firmware updates signed with legitimate vendor certificates, exploiting trusted update processes.
  * **Impacts**: Large-scale compromise, persistent backdoors, challenging remediation due to legitimate signatures.
* **Equation Group HDD Firmware Implant**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: Equation Group (allegedly NSA-linked) implanted persistent firmware-level backdoors in hard disk drive firmware from major manufacturers.
  * **Tools Used**: Specialized firmware implants and reverse-engineering tools to embed malicious functionality into HDD firmware.
  * **Impacts**: Persistent espionage capabilities, undetectable by conventional antivirus or security tools, extremely difficult to remediate.
* **BlackEnergy Firmware Attacks on ICS**:
  * **Attack Scenario**: BlackEnergy malware operators targeted firmware of industrial control systems (ICS) devices, causing operational disruption and outages.
  * **Tools Used**: BlackEnergy malware modules specifically crafted to infect and manipulate ICS device firmware.
  * **Impacts**: Operational disruptions, outages, severe impacts on industrial facilities, and critical infrastructure.

These examples illustrate the complexity, impact, and persistence associated with firmware-level attacks, highlighting the need for robust detection, prevention, and remediation strategies.

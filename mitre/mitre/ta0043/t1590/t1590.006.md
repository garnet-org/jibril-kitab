# Network Security Appliances

## Information

* Name: Network Security Appliances
* ID: T1590.006
* Tactics: [TA0043](../)
* Technique: [T1590](./)

## Introduction

Network Security Appliances (T1590.006) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader category of Gather Victim Network Information (T1590). This sub-technique describes adversaries' efforts to gather detailed information about network security devices and appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPN gateways, and other security-oriented network hardware. Attackers leverage this information to understand the victim's defensive capabilities, identify potential vulnerabilities, and plan subsequent attack techniques.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries typically gather information about network security appliances through passive reconnaissance, active scanning, and exploitation of vulnerabilities. Technical details include:

* **Passive Reconnaissance:**
  * Monitoring network traffic to identify firewall rules, allowed protocols, and security appliance configurations.
  * Analyzing public-facing documentation, vendor manuals, or online forums to infer details about deployed security appliances.
* **Active Scanning and Enumeration:**
  * Performing network scans (e.g., using Nmap) to fingerprint specific security appliances and their software versions.
  * Identifying open ports, banners, and response signatures unique to certain network security devices.
* **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:**
  * Leveraging known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in security appliances to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive configuration data.
  * Using exploits specifically targeting VPN endpoints, firewall management interfaces, or IDS/IPS management consoles.
* **Credential Harvesting and Brute Force Attacks:**
  * Attempting to gain administrative credentials to security appliances through brute force or credential stuffing attacks.
  * Exploiting default or weak administrative passwords often left unchanged on appliances.
* **Traffic Analysis and Evasion Techniques:**
  * Observing how appliances handle specific traffic types, protocols, and payloads to identify protective rules and detection thresholds.
  * Testing evasion techniques to bypass IDS/IPS signatures and firewall filtering rules.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Adversaries typically employ this sub-technique during the early phases of the cyber kill chain, specifically:

* **Reconnaissance Stage:**
  * Identifying network perimeter defenses, firewall rules, and IDS/IPS configurations.
  * Gathering intelligence about security appliance vendors, models, and software versions.
* **Initial Access and Pre-Attack Planning:**
  * Determining potential entry points and weaknesses within security appliances.
  * Planning attacks based on detailed understanding of the victim's defensive posture.
* **Persistence and Lateral Movement:**
  * Leveraging compromised security appliances to maintain persistence within the network.
  * Using knowledge of security appliance configurations to facilitate lateral movement without detection.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Analyzing security appliance behavior to craft payloads or network traffic that avoids detection.
  * Modifying attack techniques to evade known IDS/IPS signatures and firewall rules.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of adversary activities targeting network security appliances typically involves a combination of monitoring, alerting, and proactive assessment methods:

* **Network Monitoring and Traffic Analysis:**
  * Monitoring unusual scanning patterns or fingerprinting attempts against security appliances.
  * Analyzing network traffic logs for suspicious connections or probing attempts directed at management interfaces.
* **IDS/IPS and Firewall Logs:**
  * Reviewing IDS/IPS alerts for reconnaissance signatures, port scans, or vulnerability scanning activities.
  * Monitoring firewall logs for repeated access attempts, blocked connections, or anomalous traffic patterns.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools:**
  * Correlating events from various security appliances to identify coordinated reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.
  * Creating custom detection rules based on known adversarial techniques and IoCs.
* **Vulnerability Management and Configuration Auditing:**
  * Regularly scanning security appliances for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
  * Auditing appliance configurations to detect unauthorized changes or suspicious administrative activity.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual login attempts or administrative access from unfamiliar IP addresses.
  * Repeated failed authentication attempts against appliance administrative interfaces.
  * Unusual outbound traffic from security appliances indicating potential compromise or command-and-control (C2) activity.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting adversary reconnaissance or exploitation attempts against network security appliances is critical for maintaining a robust defensive posture. The importance of early detection includes:

* **Preventing Compromise of Critical Infrastructure:**
  * Security appliances often represent the first line of defense; compromise can severely weaken overall network security.
  * Early detection prevents adversaries from gaining unauthorized access and control over defensive infrastructure.
* **Reducing Risk of Data Breaches and Exfiltration:**
  * Compromised appliances can facilitate unauthorized data access, network traffic interception, or exfiltration.
  * Identifying reconnaissance activities can prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities and accessing sensitive data.
* **Mitigating Lateral Movement and Persistence:**
  * Early detection limits adversaries' ability to leverage compromised security appliances for lateral movement within the network.
  * Preventing persistence mechanisms reduces attackers' footholds and makes remediation easier.
* **Maintaining Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:**
  * Many compliance frameworks require monitoring and protecting critical infrastructure, including network security appliances.
  * Timely detection and response help organizations adhere to regulatory standards and avoid potential penalties.
* **Reducing Downtime and Operational Impact:**
  * Early identification and response minimize the operational disruption and downtime associated with compromised security devices.
  * Maintaining the integrity of security appliances ensures continuous protection and operational stability.

## Examples

Real-world examples of adversaries targeting network security appliances include:

* **Exploitation of VPN Devices (Pulse Secure, Fortinet):**
  * Attackers exploited publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2019-11510 in Pulse Secure VPN) to gain access to internal networks.
  * Impact included unauthorized access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
* **Cisco ASA Firewall Exploitation:**
  * Adversaries targeted Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) using vulnerabilities such as CVE-2018-0101 to achieve remote code execution.
  * Resulted in unauthorized administrative access, allowing attackers to modify firewall rules or intercept sensitive traffic.
* **Operation ShadowHammer (ASUS Live Update Attack):**
  * Attackers compromised network security appliances to distribute malicious updates, demonstrating the risk of supply chain attacks targeting security infrastructure.
  * Impact included widespread malware infections, data theft, and compromised endpoints.
* **APT Groups Targeting Network Appliances:**
  * Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups such as APT41 and Sandworm have been documented targeting network security appliances for espionage and sabotage purposes.
  * Techniques included exploiting vulnerabilities, credential harvesting, and persistent access to security devices.
* **Mirai Botnet Targeting IoT and Network Security Devices:**
  * Mirai malware scanned and exploited vulnerabilities in network security appliances, routers, and IoT devices to build large-scale botnets.
  * Impact included massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, network disruptions, and compromised infrastructure.

These examples illustrate the diverse approaches adversaries take to gather information and exploit network security appliances, underscoring the importance of proactive detection and robust defense measures.

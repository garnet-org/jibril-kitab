# Search Victim-Owned Websites

## Information

* Name: Search Victim-Owned Websites
* ID: T1594
* Tactics: [TA0043](./)

## Introduction

"Search Victim-Owned Websites" is a reconnaissance technique categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework as technique T1594. This technique involves adversaries actively searching websites and web servers owned or operated by the victim organization to gather sensitive information, vulnerabilities, or other actionable intelligence. Such reconnaissance allows attackers to better understand the victim's web presence, identify potential entry points, and gather contextual data useful for subsequent intrusion phases.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers perform detailed reconnaissance by systematically exploring victim-owned websites, web applications, and online assets. The goal is to extract valuable intelligence including:

* Organizational structure and employee information
* Technology stack details (web servers, CMS platforms, frameworks, libraries)
* Vulnerabilities in web applications (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, outdated software)
* Sensitive documents unintentionally exposed (e.g., configuration files, backups, credentials, API keys)
* Subdomains and associated web services that may be less secured or monitored
* Potential entry points for further exploitation (e.g., login pages, admin portals)

Execution methods include:

* Manual browsing and analysis of publicly accessible websites
* Automated crawling and scraping tools (e.g., wget, curl, HTTrack, Scrapy)
* Specialized reconnaissance tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nikto, Dirbuster, Gobuster)
* Search engine queries (Google dorks) to find indexed sensitive data
* Passive reconnaissance using online archives (e.g., Wayback Machine, archive.org) to discover historical information and past vulnerabilities

Attackers often leverage open-source intelligence (OSINT) frameworks and techniques to efficiently enumerate web assets and identify valuable targets.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This reconnaissance technique typically occurs during the initial stages of an attack lifecycle and may recur periodically as attackers search for new or updated information. Common scenarios and stages include:

* Pre-attack reconnaissance: Attackers gather intelligence before initiating active intrusion attempts.
* Initial access phase: Identifying vulnerable web applications, exposed administrative interfaces, or login forms.
* Persistence and lateral movement phases: Attackers continually monitor victim-owned websites for new vulnerabilities or exposed information that can facilitate lateral movement.
* Post-compromise intelligence collection: Attackers may revisit victim-owned websites to gather additional information useful for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.
* Targeted phishing campaigns: Attackers search victim-owned websites for employee names, email addresses, organizational charts, and other contextual information to craft convincing phishing emails.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of this reconnaissance technique typically involves monitoring web server logs, network traffic, and security events. Common detection methods and indicators include:

* Web server log analysis:
  * Unusual spikes in HTTP requests or traffic volume from unfamiliar IP addresses.
  * Requests for non-existent directories and files (indicative of brute-forcing or directory enumeration).
  * Frequent access attempts to known sensitive paths (e.g., "/admin", "/login", "/config.php", "/.git").
  * User-Agent strings associated with automated scanning tools or scripts.
* Network monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):
  * Alerts for known reconnaissance signatures (e.g., Nikto scans, Dirbuster activity).
  * Behavioral anomaly detection (e.g., traffic surges, unusual request patterns).
  * IP address reputation analysis (identifying IPs associated with known malicious actors or scanning services).
* Web Application Firewalls (WAF):
  * Detection and blocking of common reconnaissance and exploitation attempts.
  * Identifying suspicious HTTP methods (e.g., OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE) or unusual query parameters.
* Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
  * Multiple failed authentication attempts or repeated 404/403 HTTP response codes.
  * Presence of scanning tool signatures in logs (e.g., Nikto, sqlmap, Dirbuster user-agent identifiers).
  * Known malicious IPs or suspicious IP ranges appearing in access logs.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting reconnaissance activities on victim-owned websites is critical for early identification and prevention of cyberattacks. Early detection helps organizations:

* Prevent initial compromise by proactively identifying and remediating vulnerabilities before exploitation.
* Limit attacker knowledge acquisition, reducing the effectiveness of targeted attacks.
* Minimize potential damage and disruption by reducing the attacker's dwell time.
* Protect sensitive data and intellectual property from unauthorized access and exfiltration.
* Enhance overall security posture by understanding attacker behaviors and proactively strengthening defenses.

Failure to detect this technique can result in significant impacts, including:

* Unauthorized access to internal systems and sensitive information.
* Data breaches and loss of confidential or proprietary data.
* Financial losses due to regulatory fines, remediation costs, and reputational damage.
* Increased risk of advanced persistent threats (APTs) due to prolonged attacker presence.

## Examples

Real-world examples of attackers using the "Search Victim-Owned Websites" technique include:

* **APT28 (Fancy Bear)**:
  * Attack Scenario: Targeted government and military organizations using website reconnaissance to identify vulnerable web applications and exposed login pages.
  * Tools Used: Custom web scrapers, Burp Suite, manual browsing.
  * Impact: Successful phishing campaigns, initial access, and lateral movement within targeted organizations.
* **Magecart Attacks**:
  * Attack Scenario: Cybercriminal groups scanning e-commerce websites to identify outdated CMS or shopping cart software vulnerable to JavaScript injection.
  * Tools Used: Automated scanners, Nikto, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
  * Impact: Theft of payment card data, financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory penalties.
* **Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10)**:
  * Attack Scenario: Reconnaissance of managed service providers' (MSP) websites to identify web application vulnerabilities and exposed administrative interfaces.
  * Tools Used: Burp Suite, Dirbuster, Google dorks.
  * Impact: Large-scale compromise of MSPs and their clients, data exfiltration, intellectual property theft.
* **FIN7 Cybercrime Group**:
  * Attack Scenario: Searching victim-owned websites for employee information, organizational structures, and business relationships to craft targeted spear-phishing emails.
  * Tools Used: Automated web crawlers, manual browsing, OSINT techniques.
  * Impact: Successful phishing campaigns leading to financial data compromise, fraudulent transactions, and significant financial losses.

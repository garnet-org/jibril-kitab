# Exploitation for Credential Access

## Information

* Name: Exploitation for Credential Access
* ID: T1212
* Tactics: [TA0006](./)

## Introduction

Exploitation for Credential Access (Technique ID: T1212 in MITRE ATT\&CK framework) refers to adversaries leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems and applications to obtain credentials. Attackers exploit software or system weaknesses, allowing them unauthorized access to sensitive authentication data. Credential exploitation is a critical step in cyber attack chains, enabling lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistent access within compromised environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Exploitation for Credential Access involves attackers taking advantage of vulnerabilities or security weaknesses to extract authentication credentials from systems or applications. Common methods and mechanisms include:

* **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities:**
  * Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services to gain access to credential stores.
  * Vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and authentication bypass may be targeted to extract credentials.
* **Misconfigured Systems:**
  * Weak or default configurations in systems, databases, or cloud environments may expose sensitive credential information.
  * Examples include publicly accessible configuration files, insecure storage of credentials, or improper permissions on critical files.
* **Memory Dumping and Credential Extraction:**
  * Attackers leverage vulnerabilities or tools to dump memory from running processes, extracting credentials stored in cleartext or hashed forms.
  * Common targets include LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) on Windows systems, where credentials can be extracted using tools such as Mimikatz.
* **Exploiting Authentication Protocols:**
  * Exploiting weaknesses in authentication protocols like Kerberos, NTLM, or OAuth.
  * Techniques include Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, and Golden Ticket attacks.
* **Third-party Application Exploitation:**
  * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software, such as web applications, CMS platforms, or database software, to access stored credentials.

Real-world procedures typically involve initial reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, followed by targeted exploits or misconfiguration abuses to gain credential access. Once credentials are obtained, adversaries use them for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or persistent access.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Exploitation for Credential Access can occur at various stages of a cyber attack and is commonly observed in:

* **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
  * Attackers exploit publicly accessible vulnerabilities to gain initial footholds and retrieve credentials for deeper access.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Credentials obtained through exploitation can be leveraged to escalate privileges, moving from standard user accounts to administrative or root privileges.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Credentials enable attackers to move laterally across internal networks, accessing critical assets and sensitive data.
* **Persistence:**
  * Compromised credentials allow attackers to maintain persistent access, even after initial vulnerabilities have been patched.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
  * Credentials facilitate access to sensitive databases, file servers, email systems, and cloud environments, enabling attackers to exfiltrate data.

Attack scenarios include:

* Targeted attacks and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns.
* Opportunistic attacks exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities.
* Insider threats exploiting privileged access credentials.
* Supply chain attacks leveraging third-party software vulnerabilities.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Exploitation for Credential Access relies on multiple methods, tools, and indicators:

* **Monitoring and Logging:**
  * Comprehensive logging of authentication events, privilege escalations, and unusual access patterns.
  * Audit logs from Active Directory, LDAP, and cloud identity providers.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:**
  * Detection of suspicious processes, memory dumps, or tools indicative of credential extraction, such as Mimikatz or ProcDump.
  * Identification of anomalous behavior patterns, such as unusual login times, locations, or rapid credential reuse.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):**
  * Signature and behavior-based detection of known exploits targeting credential access vulnerabilities.
  * Detection of attempts to exploit authentication protocols (e.g., Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash).
* **Vulnerability Scanners and Configuration Audits:**
  * Regular vulnerability assessments and configuration management to detect misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities.
  * Identifying publicly exposed configuration files, weak permissions, or insecure credential storage.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Detection of unusual network traffic patterns, authentication protocol abuses, or credential harvesting activities.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

* Presence of known credential dumping tools (Mimikatz, LaZagne, gsecdump).
* Unusual authentication logs (failed login attempts, logins from unexpected IP addresses or geolocations).
* Memory dump files or suspicious scripts found on endpoints.
* Anomalous network traffic indicative of credential harvesting or lateral movement.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Exploitation for Credential Access early is critically important due to its significant impacts on systems and networks:

* **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers obtaining valid credentials can escalate privileges, gaining administrative control over critical systems and infrastructure.
* **Lateral Movement and Persistence:**
  * Compromised credentials facilitate lateral movement, allowing attackers to spread rapidly across internal networks and remain undetected for extended periods.
* **Data Breaches and Exfiltration:**
  * Credential exploitation often leads directly to sensitive data breaches, exposing organizations to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks.
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Attackers with administrative credentials can disrupt critical business operations, disable security controls, or deploy ransomware.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Implications:**
  * Credential exploitation incidents may violate regulatory compliance mandates (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), resulting in substantial fines and legal consequences.

Early detection enables rapid response, containment, and remediation, significantly reducing the potential damage and cost associated with credential exploitation incidents.

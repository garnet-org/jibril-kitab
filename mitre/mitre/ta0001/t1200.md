# Hardware Additions

## Information

* Name: Hardware Additions
* ID: T1200
* Tactics: [TA0001](./)

## Introduction

Hardware Additions, as defined in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework (T1200), involve adversaries introducing unauthorized hardware components into targeted systems or networks. These malicious hardware additions can range from small, covert implants to modified peripherals designed to intercept data, facilitate persistent access, or compromise system integrity. Attackers leverage this technique to bypass software-based security measures, establish persistent footholds, and maintain long-term surveillance or control over victim environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Hardware Additions encompass various methods and mechanisms, each tailored to specific attacker objectives and target environments. Key technical details include:

* **Malicious Peripheral Devices:**
  * USB devices, keyboards, mice, or chargers modified to inject keystrokes, execute scripts, or deploy malware.
  * Devices like USB Rubber Ducky or Bash Bunny that emulate legitimate peripherals to deliver payloads.
* **Network Implants:**
  * Rogue network adapters or switches installed to intercept, monitor, or redirect network traffic.
  * Hardware taps placed inline with network cables to covertly monitor communications and exfiltrate sensitive data.
* **Firmware-Level Implants:**
  * Unauthorized BIOS/UEFI implants introduced via physical access, providing persistent control even after OS reinstallation.
  * Hardware implants embedded within motherboard components or expansion cards to facilitate stealthy persistence and data theft.
* **Wireless Implants:**
  * Malicious Wi-Fi or Bluetooth hardware additions that enable attackers to remotely access or manipulate target systems.
  * Devices implanted within legitimate equipment to create covert communication channels for command-and-control (C2) traffic.
* **Surveillance Hardware:**
  * Hidden cameras, microphones, or keyloggers physically installed to capture sensitive information and credentials.
  * Hardware-based screen capture devices placed between video outputs and monitors to record user activities.

Attackers typically require initial physical access or supply-chain compromise to introduce malicious hardware. Once installed, hardware implants can remain undetected for extended periods due to their stealthy nature and minimal software footprint.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Hardware Additions can appear across multiple stages and scenarios of cyberattacks, including:

* **Initial Access:**
  * Attackers may deploy malicious hardware during physical intrusions or via compromised supply chains to gain initial footholds into secure environments.
* **Persistence:**
  * Hardware implants provide long-term, resilient persistence, surviving software-level remediation, OS reinstalls, or security updates.
* **Privilege Escalation & Credential Access:**
  * Hardware keyloggers or screen-capture devices help attackers harvest credentials, enabling further lateral movement and privilege escalation.
* **Command and Control (C2):**
  * Wireless implants or covert network devices facilitate secure and stealthy communication channels between attackers and compromised environments.
* **Exfiltration:**
  * Hardware taps and network implants passively intercept sensitive data, enabling attackers to exfiltrate information without raising alarms from traditional software-based monitoring solutions.
* **Physical Surveillance & Espionage:**
  * Malicious surveillance hardware captures sensitive conversations, meetings, and visual information, supporting espionage or industrial sabotage objectives.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malicious hardware additions involves multiple strategies, tools, and indicators:

* **Physical Inspection & Inventory:**
  * Regular, detailed physical inspections of workstations, servers, network devices, and peripherals to identify unauthorized hardware.
  * Maintaining accurate and up-to-date asset inventories to quickly detect discrepancies or unauthorized additions.
* **Network Monitoring & Anomalies:**
  * Monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns, unexpected devices, or rogue network communications.
  * Identifying unknown MAC addresses, unauthorized wireless access points, or unexpected network segments.
* **Firmware & BIOS Integrity Checks:**
  * Regular verification and monitoring of firmware and BIOS/UEFI integrity to detect unauthorized modifications or implants.
  * Tools such as CHIPSEC, Binwalk, or commercial firmware analysis solutions to identify malicious firmware implants.
* **Endpoint & Peripheral Monitoring:**
  * Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools configured to detect unauthorized peripheral devices, unusual USB activity, or suspicious hardware interactions.
  * Device control policies and USB port monitoring solutions to alert on new or unrecognized hardware connections.
* **Radio Frequency (RF) Scanning:**
  * Periodic RF spectrum analysis to detect unauthorized wireless transmissions from hidden implants or rogue wireless devices.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**

* Unknown or unauthorized hardware devices connected to systems.
* Unexpected network traffic originating from previously unknown MAC addresses or IP addresses.
* Unusual RF signals or wireless networks detected in secure environments.
* Unauthorized modifications or anomalies in firmware or BIOS integrity checks.
* Suspicious device behaviors, such as unexpected keystrokes, mouse movements, or peripheral interactions.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Hardware Additions is critical due to their significant potential impacts on organizational security, integrity, and confidentiality:

* **Persistent Compromise:**
  * Hardware implants provide attackers with persistent footholds that remain unaffected by traditional software-based remediation methods, significantly complicating incident response and recovery efforts.
* **Data Theft & Espionage:**
  * Malicious hardware enables covert interception and exfiltration of sensitive data, intellectual property, credentials, or proprietary information, leading to severe financial, operational, and reputational damage.
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Attackers leveraging hardware implants can disrupt critical infrastructure, degrade network performance, or sabotage operations, causing substantial downtime and operational losses.
* **Stealth & Detection Difficulty:**
  * Hardware implants often bypass traditional software-based security controls and monitoring tools, making early detection challenging yet crucial for effective mitigation.
* **Regulatory & Compliance Risks:**
  * Undetected hardware additions may result in compliance violations, regulatory penalties, and loss of trust from customers, partners, and stakeholders.

Early and effective detection of unauthorized hardware installations mitigates these risks, reduces potential damage, and enables organizations to respond rapidly to threats.

## Examples

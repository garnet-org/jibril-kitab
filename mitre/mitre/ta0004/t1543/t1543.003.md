# Windows Service

## Information

* Name: Windows Service
* ID: T1543.003
* Tactics: [TA0003](../../ta0003/), [TA0004](../)
* Technique: [T1543](./)

## Introduction

Windows Service (T1543.003) is a sub-technique of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the Persistence (T1543) technique category. It involves attackers creating or modifying Windows services to persistently execute malicious payloads, gain elevated privileges, or maintain access to compromised systems. Windows services are background processes managed by the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), typically running with elevated privileges, making them attractive targets for attackers seeking persistence and privilege escalation.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers leverage Windows services to establish persistent access and execute malicious payloads by performing one or more of the following actions:

* **Creating Malicious Windows Services**:
  * Attackers use built-in Windows utilities such as `sc.exe`, PowerShell cmdlets (`New-Service`, `Set-Service`), or direct registry manipulation to create new services.
  *   Commands like `sc create` or PowerShell scripts are commonly utilized:

      ```
      sc create MaliciousService binPath= "C:\malicious\payload.exe" start= auto
      ```
  * Services can be configured to run automatically upon system boot, ensuring persistent execution.
* **Modifying Existing Windows Services**:
  * Attackers may hijack legitimate Windows services by modifying their binary paths or parameters within the registry:
    *   Registry keys typically targeted:

        ```
        HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\[ServiceName]\ImagePath
        ```
  * Attackers replace or append malicious binaries or scripts to legitimate service paths, causing malicious code execution when the service starts.
* **Service DLL Injection (Svchost.exe)**:
  * Attackers abuse services running under `svchost.exe` by modifying registry keys to load malicious DLLs:
    *   Registry keys targeted:

        ```
        HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\[ServiceName]\Parameters\ServiceDll
        ```
  * DLL injection into trusted Windows processes provides stealthy persistence and makes detection more challenging.
* **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**:
  * Services typically run with elevated privileges (`SYSTEM` or administrator accounts), allowing attackers to escalate privileges.
  * Persistent execution is ensured as services automatically restart or launch upon system reboots.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly use the Windows Service (T1543.003) technique during various stages and scenarios of cyberattack campaigns, including:

* **Persistence Stage**:
  * Establishing long-term footholds in compromised networks.
  * Ensuring malicious payloads automatically execute after system reboots.
* **Privilege Escalation Stage**:
  * Exploiting services running with elevated privileges (`SYSTEM`, administrator) to escalate attacker privileges on compromised hosts.
* **Defense Evasion Stage**:
  * Leveraging legitimate Windows services to blend in with normal system activities, reducing suspicion and evading detection by security tools.
* **Initial Access and Lateral Movement**:
  * Attackers may create malicious services after initial exploitation or during lateral movement to maintain access to multiple compromised hosts across networks.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Campaigns**:
  * Long-term espionage operations frequently employ Windows service manipulation to maintain stealthy and persistent access to targeted systems.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malicious Windows services involves a combination of methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Monitoring Service Creation and Modifications**:
  * Audit Windows event logs for event IDs:
    * `4697`: Service creation events.
    * `7045`: System log event indicating new service installation.
  * Monitor registry keys related to services:
    * `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\`
  * Tools such as Sysmon can log detailed service creation and registry modification events.
* **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection**:
  * Identify unusual service names, paths, or binaries running from temporary or unexpected directories.
  * Detect services with suspicious command-line parameters or unusual dependencies.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions**:
  * Use EDR tools (CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Carbon Black) to detect suspicious service creation, modification, or DLL injection activities.
  * EDR solutions provide real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities to quickly identify malicious behaviors.
* **Indicator of Compromise (IoC) Analysis**:
  * Analyze service binaries or DLLs for known malicious hashes, signatures, or file paths.
  * Identify malicious registry entries related to services, such as unexpected `ImagePath` or `ServiceDll` values.
* **Threat Hunting Activities**:
  * Proactively search for newly created or modified services with unusual characteristics.
  * Correlate suspicious service activity with other indicators such as network connections, process injections, or privilege escalation attempts.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Windows Service (T1543.003) manipulation is critical due to its significant impact on systems and networks:

* **Long-Term Persistence**:
  * Attackers can maintain persistent and stealthy access, making remediation efforts difficult and costly.
* **Privilege Escalation Risks**:
  * Malicious services often run with elevated privileges (`SYSTEM`, administrator), allowing attackers to escalate privileges, further compromising systems and networks.
* **Increased Attack Surface and Risk Exposure**:
  * Persistent malicious services increase the attack surface, providing attackers with continuous opportunities to execute additional malicious payloads or lateral movements.
* **Stealth and Evasion**:
  * Attackers can blend malicious services with legitimate system processes, complicating detection and response efforts, and prolonging attacker dwell time.
* **Data Exfiltration and Damage**:
  * Persistent malicious services may facilitate data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or destructive attacks, causing significant operational disruptions, financial loss, and reputational damage.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Consequences**:
  * Failure to detect and remediate malicious services can lead to regulatory non-compliance, data breaches, and potential legal and regulatory penalties.

## Examples

Real-world examples of attackers leveraging Windows Service (T1543.003) include:

* **APT41 (Winnti Group)**:
  * Utilized malicious Windows services to maintain persistence and execute payloads on compromised systems.
  * Created services with legitimate-sounding names to evade detection and maintain long-term access.
* **FIN7**:
  * Employed modified Windows services to execute malicious scripts and binaries, facilitating lateral movement and data exfiltration across compromised networks.
  * Leveraged PowerShell scripts to create new malicious services and modify existing ones.
* **Lazarus Group**:
  * North Korean threat actor known to create malicious Windows services to maintain persistent access and execute espionage operations.
  * Injected malicious DLLs into legitimate Windows services (`svchost.exe`) to evade detection and maintain stealthy persistence.
* **TrickBot Malware**:
  * Created malicious services to persistently execute payloads, escalate privileges, and facilitate lateral movement within compromised enterprise environments.
  * Utilized automated scripts and malicious binaries to rapidly deploy persistent services across multiple hosts.
* **Ryuk Ransomware**:
  * Leveraged malicious Windows services to execute ransomware payloads during infection processes, ensuring persistence and complicating remediation efforts.
  * Modified existing Windows services to execute ransomware binaries upon system startup.

These examples illustrate the widespread adoption of Windows Service manipulation by various threat actors and malware families, emphasizing the importance of proactive detection and response strategies.

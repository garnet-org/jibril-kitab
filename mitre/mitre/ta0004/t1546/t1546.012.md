# Image File Execution Options Injection

## Information

* Name: Image File Execution Options Injection
* ID: T1546.012
* Tactics: [TA0004](../), [TA0003](../../ta0003/)
* Technique: [T1546](./)

## Introduction

Image File Execution Options Injection (T1546.012) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the Persistence tactic. Attackers exploit the Windows registry key "Image File Execution Options" (IFEO) to intercept and redirect the execution flow of legitimate applications. By manipulating registry entries, adversaries can force legitimate processes to execute malicious binaries, scripts, or payloads, enabling persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The Image File Execution Options (IFEO) registry key is located at:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
```

Windows uses IFEO settings primarily for debugging purposes. Specifically, the "Debugger" value can be set under a subkey named after a legitimate executable. When the target executable is run, Windows automatically executes the debugger program specified instead of the intended application.

Technical execution methods include:

* **Debugger Redirection:**
  * Adversaries set the "Debugger" registry value to point to a malicious executable.
  *   Example registry modification:

      ```
      HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Optionsotepad.exe
      Debugger = "C:\malicious\payload.exe"
      ```
  * When the user attempts to launch "notepad.exe," Windows launches "payload.exe" instead.
* **Global Flags (GlobalFlag) Manipulation:**
  * Attackers may also set the "GlobalFlag" registry entry under IFEO to enable certain debugging behaviors, potentially causing instability or facilitating malicious code execution.
* **Silent Execution:**
  * Attackers often use this technique because it can be stealthy; legitimate applications are replaced transparently, making malicious execution less obvious to end-users.

Real-world procedures typically involve:

* Using command-line tools such as `reg.exe` or PowerShell scripts to modify registry entries.
* Leveraging persistence by targeting commonly executed applications (e.g., browsers, editors, system utilities).
* Combining this technique with other persistence mechanisms to ensure redundancy and resilience against detection and removal.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attack scenarios and stages where IFEO injection typically appears include:

* **Persistence Stage:**
  * Attackers use IFEO injection to maintain persistent access to compromised systems, ensuring malicious payloads execute whenever targeted applications are launched.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * By targeting executables that run with elevated privileges, attackers can execute malicious code with higher-level permissions.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Attackers may target security software executables (antivirus, monitoring tools) to bypass or disable security protections.
* **Lateral Movement and Post-Exploitation:**
  * After initial compromise, adversaries use IFEO injection to maintain footholds on compromised hosts or pivot to other systems.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods and indicators of compromise (IoCs) include:

* **Registry Monitoring:**
  * Monitor registry keys under IFEO for unusual changes or additions, especially the "Debugger" and "GlobalFlag" values.
  * Tools such as Sysmon, Windows Event Forwarding, or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions can be configured to alert on suspicious registry modifications.
* **Process Execution Analysis:**
  * Monitor process creation events for unexpected parent-child relationships or unusual executable paths.
  * Investigate cases where a legitimate executable spawns unexpected processes or fails to run as intended.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
  * Implement FIM solutions to detect changes to critical system binaries or unexpected additions of executable files.
* **Threat Hunting Queries:**
  *   Use SIEM and EDR platforms with threat hunting queries to identify abnormal registry modifications, such as:

      ```
      reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options" /s | findstr "Debugger"
      ```

Specific IoCs include:

* Unusual registry entries under IFEO pointing to unknown or suspicious executables.
* Presence of unknown executable files in system directories or user folders referenced by IFEO keys.
* Unexpected failures or behaviors of standard applications.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of IFEO injection is critical due to the following potential impacts:

* **Persistent Compromise:**
  * IFEO injection enables attackers to maintain persistent footholds, complicating remediation efforts.
* **Privilege Escalation and System Control:**
  * Attackers can escalate privileges or execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to full system compromise.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Manipulating IFEO can disable or bypass security tools, leaving systems vulnerable to further exploitation.
* **Data Exfiltration or Destruction:**
  * Persistent access allows attackers ample opportunity to exfiltrate sensitive data or initiate destructive actions.
* **Reputation and Operational Impacts:**
  * Undetected IFEO injection can lead to prolonged compromise, resulting in regulatory compliance failures, financial losses, and reputational damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating IFEO injection:

* **Malware Families:**
  * **TrickBot Banking Trojan:**
    * TrickBot has been observed using IFEO injection to maintain persistence on infected systems by redirecting legitimate executables to malicious payloads.
    * Impact: Persistent data exfiltration, credential theft, and lateral movement.
  * **Qakbot (Qbot):**
    * Qakbot malware manipulates IFEO keys to launch malicious DLLs whenever certain legitimate processes are executed.
    * Impact: Persistent foothold, credential stealing, and lateral movement.
* **APT Groups:**
  * **APT41 (Winnti Group):**
    * Known to employ IFEO injection to maintain persistence and evade detection during long-term espionage campaigns.
    * Impact: Data theft, espionage, and prolonged compromise of targeted organizations.
* **Real Attack Scenario:**
  * Attackers compromise an organization's network via phishing or vulnerability exploitation.
  * Once inside, they modify IFEO registry entries to redirect commonly used administrative tools (e.g., taskmgr.exe, cmd.exe) to malicious payloads.
  * Administrators unknowingly execute malicious binaries, providing attackers with elevated privileges and persistent access.
  * Attackers subsequently carry out data exfiltration, lateral movement, and further compromise.

Tools commonly used by attackers for IFEO injection include:

* Native Windows utilities (`reg.exe`, PowerShell scripts).
* Open-source frameworks (Metasploit, Empire) with built-in modules for registry manipulation.
* Custom malware payloads specifically designed to automate IFEO injection for persistence.

Understanding these examples underscores the importance of proactive monitoring and timely detection of IFEO injection activities.

# AppInit DLLs

## Information

* Name: AppInit DLLs
* ID: T1546.010
* Tactics: [TA0004](../), [TA0003](../../ta0003/)
* Technique: [T1546](./)

## Introduction

The MITRE ATT\&CK sub-technique "AppInit DLLs" (T1546.010) refers to adversaries leveraging the Windows registry AppInit\_DLLs value to achieve persistence and privilege escalation. Windows systems use AppInit DLLs to load specified DLL files into every process that loads User32.dll. Attackers exploit this mechanism by inserting malicious DLLs to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence, and escalate privileges without requiring user interaction.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The AppInit DLLs functionality is tied to the Windows registry keys located at:

* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs`
* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs`

Technical execution details include:

* The registry value "AppInit\_DLLs" specifies a list of DLLs that Windows automatically loads into every process that loads User32.dll.
* Attackers place malicious DLLs into the AppInit\_DLLs registry entry, causing them to load into multiple processes, thus achieving persistence and privilege escalation.
* This technique is effective because it executes automatically upon system startup and whenever processes load User32.dll.
* Adversaries typically require administrative privileges to modify these registry keys.
* Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft introduced the "LoadAppInit\_DLLs" registry value to control this behavior, set to 0 (disabled) by default. Attackers may also modify this value (set to 1) to enable DLL loading.
* On 64-bit systems, attackers may use both 32-bit and 64-bit registry keys to ensure broader persistence and compatibility.

Real-world procedures include:

* Crafting custom malicious DLLs designed to evade detection through obfuscation and encryption.
* Utilizing scripting or command-line tools (e.g., reg.exe, PowerShell) to automate registry modifications.
* Combining this technique with other persistence mechanisms to maintain footholds in compromised environments.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attack scenarios and stages involving AppInit DLLs include:

* **Persistence Stage:** Attackers commonly use this technique to maintain persistent access after initial compromise, ensuring malicious code executes automatically on system startup.
* **Privilege Escalation Stage:** By loading malicious DLLs into processes running with elevated privileges, attackers can escalate privileges and execute code with higher permissions.
* **Defense Evasion Stage:** Adversaries may use this approach to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, evading detection by security tools that monitor process behavior.
* **Credential Theft or Keylogging:** Malicious DLLs loaded via AppInit\_DLLs can intercept user input, enabling attackers to capture credentials and sensitive information.
* **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Sophisticated threat actors frequently leverage AppInit DLLs to maintain long-term stealthy access to targeted environments.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection methods include:

* **Monitoring Registry Keys:** Continuously monitor and audit registry keys associated with AppInit DLLs for unauthorized modifications:
  * `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs`
  * `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs`
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:** Utilize EDR solutions such as CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to detect suspicious registry changes and DLL injections.
* **Process Monitoring:** Employ tools like Sysinternals Process Monitor or Process Explorer to detect unusual DLLs loaded into processes.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Security solutions leveraging behavioral analysis can detect abnormal process injections or DLL loading behaviors.
* **Event Logs and SIEM:** Correlate Windows Event Logs (e.g., Event IDs 4657, 4659 for registry modifications) with SIEM solutions to detect unauthorized registry changes.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Suspicious DLL names or paths in AppInit\_DLLs registry entries.
  * Unusual DLL files appearing in system directories (e.g., System32, SysWOW64).
  * Unexpected processes loading unknown DLLs.
  * Registry values "LoadAppInit\_DLLs" set to 1 when previously disabled (default is 0 on modern Windows versions).

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of AppInit DLLs technique is critical due to significant potential impacts, including:

* **Persistent Compromise:** Attackers can maintain long-term, stealthy access to compromised systems, complicating remediation efforts.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious DLLs injected into privileged processes can escalate attacker privileges, enabling further exploitation.
* **Credential Theft and Data Exfiltration:** DLL injection can facilitate keylogging, credential theft, and sensitive data exfiltration, causing substantial damage to organizations.
* **Defense Evasion:** Attackers leveraging this technique may evade traditional antivirus (AV) and endpoint protection platforms (EPP), increasing the difficulty of detection and mitigation.
* **Operational Disruption:** Persistent malicious DLL injections can lead to instability, crashes, or degraded performance of critical business applications.
* **Compliance and Security Risks:** Failure to detect this technique promptly can result in regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and reputational damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples involving AppInit DLLs include:

* **Carbanak/FIN7 Threat Group:**
  * Attackers used malicious DLLs loaded via AppInit\_DLLs to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and capture sensitive financial data.
  * Impact: Millions of dollars stolen from financial institutions globally; persistent compromise lasting months or years.
* **Poweliks Malware:**
  * Leveraged AppInit DLLs registry entries to inject malicious payloads into legitimate processes, evading detection by traditional antivirus tools.
  * Impact: Persistent infection, data theft, and resource hijacking on infected systems.
* **Andromeda (Gamarue) Malware:**
  * Utilized AppInit DLLs to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, establishing persistent backdoors and command-and-control (C2) communication channels.
  * Impact: Large-scale botnet infections, credential theft, and unauthorized remote access.
* **TrickBot Banking Trojan:**
  * Deployed DLL injections via AppInit DLLs to maintain persistence, evade detection, and steal banking credentials from compromised systems.
  * Impact: Financial losses, compromised account credentials, and widespread infections across enterprises.

In these examples, adversaries successfully leveraged AppInit DLLs to achieve persistence, escalate privileges, evade detection, and cause significant financial and operational impacts.

# Device Registration

## Information

* Name: Device Registration
* ID: T1098.005
* Tactics: [TA0003](../../ta0003/), [TA0004](../)
* Technique: [T1098](./)

## Introduction

Device Registration (T1098.005) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader "Account Manipulation" technique (T1098). It involves adversaries registering unauthorized devices or systems within an organization's network or cloud environment, thereby gaining persistent access and evading detection. By registering malicious or compromised devices, attackers can blend in with legitimate infrastructure, making their activities appear normal and authorized. This sub-technique is commonly leveraged to establish persistence, maintain stealth, and facilitate lateral movement within targeted environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries exploit device registration by adding unauthorized endpoints or virtual devices into legitimate management systems, Active Directory (AD), Azure AD, or other identity and access management (IAM) systems. This registration can be performed via various methods:

* **Manual Registration:** Attackers with sufficient privileges manually add compromised or attacker-controlled devices into the organization's directory services or endpoint management solutions.
* **Automated Scripted Registration:** Attackers may use automated scripts or command-line tools such as PowerShell, Azure CLI, or specialized APIs to rapidly register multiple devices, thereby scaling their access.
* **Compromise of Device Enrollment Credentials:** Attackers may obtain legitimate device enrollment credentials or tokens through credential theft, phishing, or social engineering, allowing them to register devices without raising immediate alarms.
* **Use of Stolen or Forged Certificates:** Attackers may use compromised or forged certificates to authenticate and register malicious devices, bypassing standard device authentication checks.

Once registered, these devices may:

* Appear legitimate to endpoint management platforms such as Microsoft Intune, SCCM, Jamf, or Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions.
* Gain access to sensitive resources, applications, or data within the environment.
* Facilitate lateral movement and allow attackers to pivot to other systems or escalate privileges.
* Remain persistent and evade standard detection mechanisms due to their authorized and legitimate appearance.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Device Registration (T1098.005) is typically employed during specific stages of a cyberattack lifecycle, including:

* **Persistence Stage:** Attackers leverage device registration to maintain a foothold within compromised environments, ensuring continued access even after initial entry points are identified and remediated.
* **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:** By registering devices as legitimate endpoints, attackers can evade detection mechanisms, bypass network segmentation controls, and escalate privileges by blending into trusted device groups.
* **Lateral Movement:** Once a device is registered and trusted, attackers can pivot internally, accessing resources and systems that rely on device trust relationships.
* **Post-Compromise Expansion:** After initial access, attackers may register additional malicious devices to expand their presence within the compromised network or cloud environment.

Common scenarios include:

* Cloud-based attacks targeting Azure AD or other cloud IAM solutions.
* Enterprise environments relying heavily on endpoint management platforms (Intune, Jamf, SCCM).
* Organizations using automated provisioning and device enrollment processes that attackers can exploit.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of unauthorized device registration requires careful monitoring, auditing, and correlation of identity-related events. Common detection methods include:

* **Endpoint and Device Inventory Audits:** Regular audits and automated inventory checks can identify newly registered devices that do not match known device naming conventions, hardware specifications, or enrollment patterns.
* **Log Analysis and SIEM Monitoring:** Aggregation and analysis of logs from directory services (Active Directory, Azure AD), endpoint management platforms (Intune, SCCM), and certificate authorities can reveal suspicious registration activities.
* **Behavioral Analytics:** Machine learning and behavioral analytics tools can identify abnormal patterns, such as sudden bursts of new device registrations, unusual geographic locations, or atypical enrollment times.
* **Monitoring of Enrollment Tokens and Certificates:** Tracking the usage of device enrollment tokens, certificates, and credentials can help detect unauthorized or unexpected registrations.
* **Alerts on Privileged Account Activity:** Monitoring privileged accounts or service accounts that can register devices can highlight unauthorized or suspicious device registration activities.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

* Unrecognized device names, hardware identifiers, or serial numbers.
* Device registrations originating from unusual geographic locations or IP addresses.
* Sudden spikes in device enrollment activities.
* Usage of compromised or suspicious certificates or tokens.
* Devices enrolled by accounts not typically associated with device registration.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting unauthorized device registration is critical due to its significant potential impacts on organizations, including:

* **Persistence and Long-Term Access:** Attackers can use registered devices to maintain persistent, long-term access to sensitive data and systems, even after initial compromise points are remediated.
* **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:** Registered devices can bypass security controls, facilitating attackers' lateral movement and privilege escalation within the network.
* **Data Exfiltration Risk:** Attackers can leverage registered devices to access, exfiltrate, or manipulate sensitive data, leading to significant data breaches and compliance violations.
* **Operational Disruption and Business Impact:** Unauthorized device registration can disrupt legitimate device and endpoint management processes, causing operational inefficiencies or downtime.
* **Increased Detection Difficulty:** Devices registered through legitimate channels can evade traditional detection mechanisms, highlighting the importance of proactive detection and monitoring strategies.

Early detection enables organizations to:

* Rapidly identify and isolate unauthorized devices.
* Minimize the scope and impact of potential breaches.
* Strengthen overall security posture by improving visibility and control over device enrollment processes.

## Examples

Real-world examples and scenarios involving Device Registration (T1098.005):

* **SolarWinds Compromise:** Attackers leveraged compromised identities and credentials to register unauthorized devices within Azure AD environments. Once registered, these devices facilitated lateral movement, persistence, and data exfiltration.
  * **Tools and Techniques Used:** Azure Active Directory PowerShell modules, compromised credentials, and automated scripting.
  * **Impacts:** Long-term persistence, lateral movement, and sensitive data exfiltration impacting multiple high-profile organizations.
* **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Activities:** Known to compromise cloud infrastructure and leverage device registration to maintain persistent access to targeted environments.
  * **Tools and Techniques Used:** Credential harvesting, Azure CLI, PowerShell scripting, and forged certificates.
  * **Impacts:** Persistent espionage activities, sensitive data theft, and significant operational disruption.
* **Compromised Mobile Device Management (MDM) Platforms:** Attackers have registered malicious devices within enterprise MDM solutions, enabling persistent access to sensitive corporate data and applications.
  * **Tools and Techniques Used:** Compromised enrollment tokens, phishing attacks, and unauthorized device enrollment scripts.
  * **Impacts:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to corporate applications, and prolonged attacker presence within enterprise environments.

These examples underscore the critical importance of monitoring and securing device registration processes to mitigate this sub-technique's risks and impacts.

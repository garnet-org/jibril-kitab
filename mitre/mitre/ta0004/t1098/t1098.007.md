# Additional Local or Domain Groups

## Information

* Name: Additional Local or Domain Groups
* ID: T1098.007
* Tactics: [TA0003](../../ta0003/), [TA0004](../)
* Technique: [T1098](./)

## Introduction

The MITRE ATT\&CK sub-technique "Additional Local or Domain Groups" (T1098.007) falls under the broader technique of Account Manipulation (T1098). It refers to adversaries creating or modifying local or domain groups within a compromised environment to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or facilitate lateral movement. Attackers leverage these groups to blend in with normal administrative activities, making detection challenging. Understanding this sub-technique is essential for defenders to recognize unauthorized alterations to group accounts and mitigate potential threats.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers performing this sub-technique typically follow these technical steps:

* **Local Group Creation or Modification:**
  * Attackers may create or modify local groups on compromised endpoints to establish persistence and maintain control.
  * Using built-in utilities such as `net.exe`, `net localgroup`, or PowerShell cmdlets (`New-LocalGroup`, `Add-LocalGroupMember`), attackers can silently establish new groups or add compromised accounts to existing groups.
* **Domain Group Creation or Modification:**
  * Attackers with domain admin privileges or sufficient permissions may create new domain groups or modify existing ones to facilitate lateral movement and privilege escalation across the domain.
  * Common tools and techniques include Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), PowerShell AD cmdlets (e.g., `New-ADGroup`, `Add-ADGroupMember`), or direct LDAP queries and modifications.
* **Group Nesting and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Adversaries may nest groups strategically to inherit permissions from higher-privileged groups, thus indirectly escalating privileges without attracting immediate attention.
  * Attackers could add their compromised accounts to existing privileged groups such as "Domain Admins," "Enterprise Admins," or custom administrative groups.
* **Persistence and Stealth:**
  * Creating additional groups allows attackers to maintain persistent access even if individual compromised accounts are discovered and disabled.
  * Attackers often use innocuous-sounding group names or mimic legitimate administrative groups to avoid suspicion.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers employ "Additional Local or Domain Groups" in various stages and scenarios, including:

* **Privilege Escalation:**
  * Attackers add compromised accounts to privileged groups or create new groups with high-level privileges to escalate their access rights.
* **Persistence:**
  * Creating or modifying groups ensures persistent access, even if initial compromised accounts are disabled or passwords changed.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Domain groups provide attackers the means to move laterally across multiple systems within the domain, leveraging inherited permissions and trust relationships.
* **Credential Access and Reconnaissance:**
  * Attackers may use group memberships to enumerate additional targets, gather credentials, or identify sensitive assets within Active Directory environments.
* **Defense Evasion:**
  * Attackers create or modify groups with names similar to legitimate administrative groups to blend in and evade detection by security teams.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of "Additional Local or Domain Groups" typically involves monitoring, auditing, and analyzing group membership changes and creation events:

* **Event Log Monitoring:**
  * Windows Security Event Logs, especially Event IDs:
    * **4727**: A security-enabled global group was created.
    * **4731**: A security-enabled local group was created.
    * **4754**: A security-enabled universal group was created.
    * **4728, 4732, 4756**: Members were added to security-enabled groups.
  * Regular monitoring and alerting on these events can help identify suspicious group activity.
* **Audit Policies and SIEM Solutions:**
  * Implement advanced audit policies to log group creation and membership changes.
  * Centralize log aggregation and correlation using SIEM solutions (e.g., Splunk, ELK, QRadar) to detect unusual patterns or anomalies.
* **Active Directory Monitoring Tools:**
  * Utilize specialized Active Directory monitoring tools (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Identity, BloodHound, PingCastle) to detect unusual group nesting or privilege escalation paths.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * EDR solutions can detect suspicious command-line activities (e.g., `net localgroup`, PowerShell cmdlets) indicative of unauthorized group manipulation.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unrecognized or newly created administrative groups.
  * Unexpected additions of standard user accounts into privileged groups.
  * Suspicious PowerShell scripts or command-line arguments related to group management.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of "Additional Local or Domain Groups" is critical due to the following potential impacts:

* **Privilege Escalation Risks:**
  * Attackers who successfully manipulate groups can escalate privileges, gaining administrative or system-level access, and significantly increasing their potential damage and control.
* **Persistence and Long-Term Compromise:**
  * Attackers can maintain persistent access through group memberships, even after initial compromised accounts are remediated, resulting in prolonged threats within the environment.
* **Lateral Movement and Wider Compromise:**
  * Unauthorized domain group modifications enable attackers to move laterally across multiple systems, potentially compromising critical infrastructure, sensitive data, and intellectual property.
* **Evasion of Detection and Defense Mechanisms:**
  * Attackers who blend into legitimate administrative groups or mimic standard naming conventions may evade detection and continue malicious activities unnoticed.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Risks:**
  * Unauthorized group changes may lead to compliance violations, audit failures, and regulatory penalties.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of "Additional Local or Domain Groups" include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**
  * During the SolarWinds supply chain compromise, APT29 leveraged domain administrative privileges to create new Active Directory groups and add compromised accounts, enabling lateral movement and persistence across victim networks.
* **FIN6 Group:**
  * FIN6 attackers have been observed creating new local administrative groups on compromised point-of-sale (POS) systems, allowing persistent access and facilitating further data exfiltration activities.
* **Ryuk Ransomware Attacks:**
  * Attackers deploying Ryuk ransomware frequently manipulate domain groups, adding compromised accounts into privileged groups to spread ransomware rapidly across victim organizations.
* **PowerSploit Framework:**
  * Attackers leveraging PowerSploit scripts often use PowerShell cmdlets (`New-ADGroup`, `Add-ADGroupMember`) to create and modify domain groups silently, establishing persistent and privileged access.
* **TrickBot Malware:**
  * TrickBot operators have been known to enumerate and modify local group memberships using built-in Windows utilities (`net localgroup`) to escalate privileges and maintain persistence on compromised endpoints.

These examples highlight the importance of monitoring and detecting unauthorized group creation or modifications to mitigate risks associated with this sub-technique.

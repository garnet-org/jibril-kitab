# Network Devices

## Information

* Name: Network Devices
* ID: T1584.008
* Tactics: [TA0042](../)
* Technique: [T1584](./)

## Introduction

Network Devices \[T1584.008] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under the resource development tactic. It involves adversaries compromising, hijacking, or otherwise exploiting network devices—such as routers, switches, firewalls, and network appliances—to support their operations. These compromised devices enable attackers to mask their activities, pivot through networks, redirect traffic, and establish persistent access.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers targeting network devices typically exploit vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weak authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access. Once compromised, these devices can serve multiple malicious purposes:

* **Traffic Redirection and Manipulation:**
  * Attackers may alter routing tables or DNS settings on compromised routers to redirect legitimate user traffic through attacker-controlled infrastructure.
  * DNS hijacking or BGP route hijacking can divert traffic to malicious servers, facilitating credential harvesting, malware delivery, or espionage.
* **Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure:**
  * Network devices, especially routers and firewalls, can be repurposed as stealthy command-and-control servers due to their strategic network positioning and limited monitoring.
  * Attackers leverage these devices to relay commands, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistent backdoors.
* **Network Reconnaissance and Pivoting:**
  * Compromised devices allow attackers to map network topology, scan internal hosts, and pivot further into internal segments.
  * Attackers can use network appliances as jump points to evade detection and bypass traditional perimeter defenses.
* **Persistence and Stealth:**
  * Network devices often have minimal security monitoring and logging, making persistence easier and detection difficult.
  * Firmware implants or modified device configurations can persist across reboots and software updates, providing long-term stealthy access.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers use compromised network devices across various stages of cyber operations, including:

* **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
  * Exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible network devices to gain initial footholds into targeted networks.
  * Conducting reconnaissance to understand network architecture, identify valuable targets, and plan subsequent attack phases.
* **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
  * Establishing covert communication channels through compromised network devices to control malware and exfiltrate data without raising suspicion.
* **Lateral Movement and Pivoting:**
  * Utilizing compromised network infrastructure to pivot internally and reach sensitive or segmented network areas.
* **Persistence and Long-term Operations:**
  * Maintaining persistent access through compromised network devices, ensuring continued presence even after initial malware removal or remediation efforts.
* **Traffic Manipulation and Credential Harvesting:**
  * Hijacking DNS or routing protocols to intercept sensitive data, credentials, or redirect users to malicious sites.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of compromised network devices involves multiple strategies, including:

* **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  * Monitoring unexpected or unauthorized traffic flows, especially unusual DNS queries or routing changes.
  * Detecting unexpected outbound connections from network devices to unknown external IP addresses or domains.
* **Configuration and Integrity Monitoring:**
  * Regularly auditing network device configurations for unauthorized changes, suspicious user accounts, or altered access control lists (ACLs).
  * Employing automated integrity checking tools to detect firmware tampering or unauthorized software installations.
* **Logging and Event Monitoring:**
  * Enabling comprehensive logging on network devices and integrating logs into centralized SIEM solutions.
  * Analyzing logs for suspicious login attempts, failed authentications, sudden configuration changes, or unexpected reboots.
* **Vulnerability Assessments and Patch Management:**
  * Regularly scanning network devices for known vulnerabilities, outdated firmware, and weak authentication methods.
  * Applying security patches promptly to mitigate exploitation risks.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual network routes or unrecognized DNS servers configured on devices.
  * Unexpected administrative accounts or password changes on network devices.
  * Firmware hashes or file checksums differing from vendor-provided baselines.
  * Suspicious outbound connections from network devices to external IP addresses or domains.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting compromised network devices is critical due to the significant risks posed to organizations, including:

* **Data Exfiltration and Espionage:**
  * Attackers can intercept and exfiltrate sensitive information, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII).
* **Operational Disruption:**
  * Manipulation of routing tables or DNS settings can disrupt legitimate network services, causing downtime, degraded performance, or denial-of-service conditions.
* **Credential Theft and Account Compromise:**
  * Redirecting legitimate traffic to malicious servers enables attackers to steal user credentials, leading to further compromise of critical systems and accounts.
* **Persistent and Stealthy Access:**
  * Network devices are often overlooked during security monitoring, allowing attackers prolonged undetected access, significantly increasing the potential damage.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Risks:**
  * Failure to detect and remediate compromised network infrastructure can result in regulatory non-compliance, potential fines, and reputational damage.

Early detection and remediation of compromised network devices significantly reduce these risks and limit attackers' ability to escalate and persist within organizational networks.

## Examples

Real-world examples of adversaries compromising network devices include:

* **VPNFilter Malware Campaign (2018):**
  * Attackers infected hundreds of thousands of routers worldwide with VPNFilter malware.
  * Malware capabilities included traffic interception, credential theft, and destructive payloads capable of rendering devices unusable.
  * Impact: Potential large-scale espionage, data theft, and disruption of critical network infrastructure.
* **Cisco Router Exploit by APT28 (Fancy Bear):**
  * Advanced Persistent Threat group APT28 targeted Cisco routers using SNMP vulnerabilities.
  * Attackers deployed SYNful Knock implants to maintain persistent access, pivot internally, and exfiltrate sensitive data.
  * Impact: Persistent espionage operations, data exfiltration, and stealthy lateral movement within compromised networks.
* **Sea Turtle DNS Hijacking Campaign (2019):**
  * Attackers compromised DNS infrastructure and network devices to redirect legitimate traffic to attacker-controlled servers.
  * Targeted government organizations, telecommunications providers, and internet infrastructure companies.
  * Impact: Credential theft, espionage, and significant operational disruption.
* **Slingshot APT Malware (2018):**
  * Attackers compromised MikroTik routers to deliver malware payloads to connected computers.
  * Malware facilitated espionage capabilities, including keystroke logging, screen capture, and data exfiltration.
  * Impact: Persistent access, espionage, and data theft from targeted organizations.

These examples highlight attackers' strategic use of compromised network devices to facilitate espionage, credential theft, persistent access, and operational disruption.

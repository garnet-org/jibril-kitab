# Exploits

## Information

* Name: Exploits
* ID: T1587.004
* Tactics: [TA0042](../)
* Technique: [T1587](./)

## Introduction

Exploits \[T1587.004] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader "Develop Capabilities" tactic. This sub-technique specifically refers to adversaries developing or acquiring exploits targeting vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or firmware. Exploits are tools or techniques used to take advantage of weaknesses, enabling adversaries to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code within targeted systems.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Exploits \[T1587.004] involve adversaries actively researching, developing, or purchasing exploits that target known or unknown vulnerabilities. These exploits typically target software, operating systems, network infrastructure, firmware, or hardware components.

Detailed technical aspects of exploit development and execution include:

* **Vulnerability Identification and Research:**
  * Adversaries continuously monitor security disclosures, vulnerability databases, security advisories, and underground forums to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
  * Vulnerabilities may be zero-day (previously unknown to defenders) or known but not yet patched or mitigated.
* **Exploit Development:**
  * Development typically involves reverse engineering, fuzzing, debugging, and analyzing target software or systems to discover exploitable weaknesses.
  * Common exploit categories include buffer overflows, use-after-free, race conditions, SQL injection, command injection, and authentication bypass exploits.
* **Exploit Delivery and Execution:**
  * Exploits may be delivered through phishing emails, watering hole attacks, malicious websites, or embedded in software updates.
  * Exploit payloads can include shellcode, scripts, or binaries designed to execute arbitrary code, gain remote access, or escalate privileges.
* **Exploit Kits and Frameworks:**
  * Adversaries may use exploit kits (e.g., Angler, Magnitude, RIG) or exploit frameworks (e.g., Metasploit) to simplify exploit delivery and execution.
  * These kits typically automate vulnerability scanning, exploit selection, payload delivery, and post-exploitation actions.
* **Zero-Day Exploits:**
  * Zero-day exploits are particularly valuable as they target undisclosed vulnerabilities, making detection and prevention challenging.
  * These are often sold or exchanged on underground markets, and their use indicates advanced adversaries or state-sponsored threat actors.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Adversaries employ exploits \[T1587.004] across multiple stages and scenarios of cyber-attacks, including:

* **Initial Access Stage:**
  * Exploits targeting internet-facing applications, network devices, or user endpoints to gain initial footholds into networks.
* **Privilege Escalation Stage:**
  * Exploits for vulnerabilities in operating systems, kernel-level drivers, or critical software components to elevate privileges from standard user to administrator or system-level accounts.
* **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
  * Exploits targeting firmware or hardware vulnerabilities to implant persistent backdoors or evade endpoint detection mechanisms.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Exploits targeting internal network services, protocols, or authentication mechanisms to move laterally within compromised networks.
* **Exfiltration and Impact:**
  * Exploiting vulnerabilities in data handling, encryption mechanisms, or data storage systems to facilitate data exfiltration or destructive attacks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of exploits \[T1587.004] involves multiple methodologies, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * Monitoring endpoint activities, memory analysis, process injection, and abnormal privilege escalations.
  * Detecting exploit payload execution, shellcode behavior, or unusual API calls.
* **Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS):**
  * Signature-based detection of known exploit payloads or exploit kit traffic.
  * Behavioral detection of anomalous network traffic patterns, unusual protocol usage, or exploit delivery attempts.
* **Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management Tools:**
  * Identifying vulnerable software, firmware, or hardware assets proactively.
  * Prioritizing patching and mitigation efforts to reduce exploit risk.
* **Threat Intelligence Platforms:**
  * Leveraging threat intelligence feeds, IoC databases, and security advisories to identify known exploits and exploit-related activities.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Known exploit payload hashes, file names, or signatures.
  * Suspicious network connections to known exploit kit domains or IP addresses.
  * Unusual log entries indicating exploit attempts, crashes, or abnormal application behavior.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
  * Correlating logs from endpoints, network devices, and applications to detect exploit attempts or successful exploitation activities.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of exploits \[T1587.004] is critical due to the severe potential impacts on systems, networks, and organizations, including:

* **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Exploits enable adversaries to bypass authentication and gain elevated privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
* **Data Breaches and Exfiltration:**
  * Exploits facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive data, intellectual property, personally identifiable information (PII), or financial records, leading to data breaches and regulatory penalties.
* **Persistence and Long-term Compromise:**
  * Exploits targeting firmware or hardware vulnerabilities can implant persistent backdoors that survive reboots, reimaging, or standard security measures.
* **Operational Downtime and Disruption:**
  * Exploits can cause application crashes, denial-of-service conditions, or destructive impacts, leading to operational downtime and financial losses.
* **Reputational and Compliance Risks:**
  * Successful exploitation can severely damage organizational reputation and result in regulatory fines, legal actions, or loss of customer trust.

Early detection and mitigation significantly reduce these risks, enabling defenders to remediate vulnerabilities, isolate affected systems, and prevent further adversary actions.

## Examples

Real-world examples of exploits \[T1587.004] include:

* **EternalBlue Exploit (CVE-2017-0144):**
  * Targeted SMB vulnerability in Windows operating systems.
  * Used in WannaCry ransomware attacks and NotPetya destructive malware, causing widespread global damage and financial losses.
* **ProxyLogon Exploit (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-27065):**
  * Targeted Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities.
  * Actively exploited by threat actors for initial access and data exfiltration in widespread espionage campaigns.
* **Log4Shell Exploit (CVE-2021-44228):**
  * Targeted Apache Log4j library vulnerability.
  * Exploited by numerous threat actors for initial access, remote code execution, and ransomware deployment.
* **PrintNightmare Exploit (CVE-2021-34527):**
  * Targeted Windows Print Spooler vulnerability.
  * Exploited for privilege escalation and lateral movement within enterprise networks.
* **BlueKeep Exploit (CVE-2019-0708):**
  * Targeted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) vulnerability in Windows systems.
  * Exploited for remote code execution and potential worm-like propagation across networks.

In each of these examples, adversaries leveraged exploits to achieve initial access, escalate privileges, and execute malicious payloads, highlighting the critical importance of proactive vulnerability management and exploit detection.

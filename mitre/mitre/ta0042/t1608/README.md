## Introduction

Stage Capabilities is a technique categorized under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, which attackers leverage to position tools, scripts, or payloads in specific locations within compromised environments. This technique is essential for attackers to ensure persistence, facilitate lateral movement, maintain operational security, and prepare for further malicious activities. Staging capabilities typically involve placing resources in areas that are easily accessible and inconspicuous, allowing attackers to execute payloads and scripts efficiently while minimizing detection.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers utilize the Stage Capabilities technique to strategically place tools, scripts, binaries, or payloads onto compromised systems or intermediary staging servers. Detailed technical insights include the following aspects:

* **Execution Methods:**
  * Uploading malicious scripts or binaries via remote access tools (RATs), command-and-control (C2) channels, or compromised legitimate services.
  * Storing payloads in publicly accessible or internal network locations to retrieve them later using built-in system utilities like `curl`, `wget`, `bitsadmin`, or PowerShell commands.
* **Mechanisms and Procedures:**
  * Attackers often stage payloads on compromised web servers, cloud storage providers, or internal file shares to avoid direct downloads from external suspicious domains.
  * Payloads can be encrypted or obfuscated to evade signature-based detection.
  * Scripts or binaries may be temporarily stored in memory or hidden directories to reduce detection likelihood.
  * Attackers may leverage legitimate system tools (LOLBins) to download and execute staged resources, further complicating detection.
* **Real-world Procedures:**
  * Use of compromised third-party websites or legitimate cloud services like GitHub, Pastebin, AWS S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox as staging areas.
  * Employing encoded PowerShell scripts that retrieve payloads from staged locations at runtime.
  * Utilizing internal file shares or network drives to stage tools for lateral movement and persistence within victim environments.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly use Stage Capabilities in multiple attack scenarios and stages, including:

* **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
  * Immediately after initial compromise to deliver secondary payloads or exploitation tools.
* **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
  * Staging persistent backdoors or privilege escalation tools for later execution.
* **Lateral Movement:**
  * Staging reconnaissance scripts, credential dumping tools, or lateral movement tools on internal shared resources.
* **Command and Control (C2):**
  * Storing payloads on intermediary staging servers or cloud services to distance attackers from direct connections and evade detection.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
  * Temporarily staging data collection scripts or exfiltration tools to facilitate data extraction.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Stage Capabilities involves monitoring, analysis, and alerting on multiple indicators and behaviors, including:

* **Network Monitoring:**
  * Detecting unusual outbound connections to cloud storage providers, unknown external IP addresses, or suspicious domains.
  * Identifying abnormal internal network traffic patterns indicative of lateral movement or internal staging.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  * Monitoring file creation and modification events, especially in unusual or hidden directories.
  * Detecting suspicious usage of system utilities (`curl`, `wget`, `bitsadmin`, PowerShell) for downloading or executing files.
* **Behavioral Analysis:**
  * Observing sudden appearance of encoded or obfuscated scripts or binaries on systems.
  * Detecting unusual process creation events or execution of scripts from temporary or uncommon locations.
* **Log Analysis and SIEM Tools:**
  * Analyzing logs for suspicious file transfers, downloads, or execution events.
  * Identifying unauthorized access or modifications to shared resources or cloud storage accounts.
* **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Unusual file hashes or filenames associated with known malicious tools.
  * Suspicious URLs, IP addresses, or domain names detected in logs.
  * Unexpected scheduled tasks or registry entries referencing staged payloads.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Stage Capabilities is critical due to the following potential impacts and risks:

* **Persistence and Long-term Access:**
  * Attackers often stage persistent backdoors, enabling them to maintain prolonged access to compromised networks.
* **Facilitation of Further Attacks:**
  * Staged tools can be leveraged for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration, significantly increasing the scope and severity of an attack.
* **Operational Security (OPSEC) for Attackers:**
  * Attackers use staging to minimize direct connections, making attribution and incident response more challenging.
* **Reduced Visibility and Detection Difficulty:**
  * Staged payloads on legitimate services or internal resources often evade traditional signature-based detection methods, highlighting the need for proactive behavioral monitoring.
* **Potential Data Breaches and Financial Losses:**
  * Staged exfiltration tools and scripts can lead to sensitive data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and financial impacts.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Stage Capabilities include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear):**
  * Utilized publicly accessible cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive to stage payloads and scripts, enabling them to evade traditional detection mechanisms.
  * Employed encoded PowerShell scripts to retrieve staged payloads, facilitating lateral movement and persistence within targeted networks.
* **FIN7:**
  * Leveraged compromised legitimate websites and cloud storage providers to stage malware payloads, reducing the risk of detection and attribution.
  * Used legitimate Windows utilities like `bitsadmin` and PowerShell to download and execute staged resources, blending malicious activities with normal system operations.
* **Cobalt Strike Framework:**
  * Attackers frequently use Cobalt Strike to stage payloads on compromised servers or cloud storage, allowing subsequent retrieval and execution via beacon commands.
  * Payloads are often obfuscated or encrypted to evade antivirus and endpoint detection tools.
* **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack:**
  * Attackers staged malicious payloads on compromised update servers, enabling widespread distribution and stealthy deployment across numerous victim organizations.
  * Utilized internal staging techniques to minimize external network connections and evade detection.
* **Emotet Malware:**
  * Emotet operators staged secondary payloads (such as Trickbot or Ryuk ransomware) on compromised web servers or legitimate cloud services, enabling modular and flexible delivery mechanisms.
  * Used encoded scripts and legitimate system tools to retrieve and execute staged payloads, complicating detection and response efforts.

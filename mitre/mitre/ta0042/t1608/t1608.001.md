# Upload Malware

## Information

* Name: Upload Malware
* ID: T1608.001
* Tactics: [TA0042](../)
* Technique: [T1608](./)

## Introduction

The MITRE ATT\&CK sub-technique "Upload Malware" (T1608.001) falls under the broader "Stage Capabilities" (T1608) technique. It describes adversaries uploading malicious software or payloads onto compromised infrastructure or third-party hosting platforms. Attackers commonly leverage this method to prepare malware for subsequent distribution, execution, or delivery onto targeted systems. This sub-technique is essential for adversaries aiming to stage attacks, maintain persistence, or facilitate lateral movement within victim environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers utilizing the "Upload Malware" sub-technique typically perform the following actions:

* **Infrastructure Preparation**: Adversaries may upload malware to compromised servers, cloud storage services, legitimate file-sharing platforms, or dedicated attacker-controlled infrastructure. They often choose platforms that appear legitimate or trusted, making detection more challenging.
* **File Types and Formats**: Uploaded malware can include various file types:
  * Executables (.exe, .dll, .bin)
  * Scripts (.ps1, .bat, .sh, .py)
  * Office documents with embedded macros (.docm, .xlsm)
  * Archives (.zip, .rar, .7z)
  * Encoded or encrypted payloads to evade detection mechanisms
* **Delivery Mechanisms**: After uploading malware, adversaries commonly distribute it via:
  * Phishing emails containing links or attachments pointing to uploaded malware
  * Malicious websites redirecting visitors to download payloads
  * Exploitation frameworks or command-and-control (C2) servers retrieving malware from staged locations
* **Obfuscation and Evasion Techniques**: Attackers often employ methods to avoid detection, including:
  * Encryption or encoding of payloads
  * File compression or packing
  * Renaming files to mimic legitimate software or system files
  * Hosting malware on reputable or trusted cloud services to bypass security controls
* **Access Control and Permissions**: Attackers may leverage compromised credentials or vulnerabilities to gain write permissions on legitimate servers, enabling malware uploads.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique typically appears in various stages of an attack lifecycle, including:

* **Initial Access and Delivery**:
  * Attackers upload malware to web servers or file-sharing platforms before initiating phishing campaigns or drive-by downloads.
* **Execution and Exploitation**:
  * Malware is uploaded to compromised infrastructure or staging servers to facilitate payload retrieval during exploitation of vulnerabilities.
* **Persistence and Lateral Movement**:
  * Adversaries upload malware to internal servers or shared resources to propagate across networks, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges.
* **Command-and-Control (C2) Infrastructure Setup**:
  * Malware payloads are often uploaded to attacker-controlled servers or cloud storage to serve as download points for compromised hosts connecting to C2 infrastructure.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malware uploads typically involves a combination of proactive monitoring, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence:

* **Network Monitoring and Analysis**:
  * Inspect network traffic for suspicious file uploads, especially to external or unrecognized IP addresses or domains.
  * Detect unusual outbound traffic patterns or large data transfers indicative of malware uploads.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  * Identify suspicious file creation events or file uploads from endpoints.
  * Monitor file system activities for unusual file extensions, encrypted or encoded payloads, and files appearing in unexpected directories.
* **Log Analysis and SIEM Integration**:
  * Analyze server logs (web server, FTP, cloud storage) for unusual upload events, timestamps, or source IP addresses.
  * Correlate logs across multiple sources to identify anomalous upload patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
* **Threat Intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  * Utilize known malicious file hashes, filenames, domains, or IP addresses associated with malware uploads.
  * Leverage threat intelligence feeds and platforms to detect known malicious infrastructure or upload activity.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:
  * Deploy file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized file uploads or changes on critical servers and infrastructure.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

* Suspicious file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
* Unrecognized or unusual file types or extensions appearing on servers
* Unexpected file uploads from unknown or suspicious IP addresses
* Connections to known malicious upload domains or cloud storage services

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of the "Upload Malware" sub-technique is critical due to its potential impacts and consequences:

* **Initial Compromise and Infection**:
  * Uploaded malware often signifies the initial stage of a broader attack, potentially leading to severe compromise of systems and networks.
* **Persistence and Escalation**:
  * Malware uploads can enable attackers to maintain persistent access, escalate privileges, or facilitate lateral movement within networks, increasing the severity and scope of compromises.
* **Data Exfiltration and Breaches**:
  * Uploaded malware may include tools designed for data theft, espionage, or ransomware attacks, resulting in financial loss, data breaches, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.
* **Rapid Response and Mitigation**:
  * Detecting malware uploads early allows organizations to quickly isolate infected systems, remediate compromised infrastructure, and prevent further propagation.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**:
  * Organizations often face regulatory obligations to detect, report, and mitigate malware incidents promptly, making detection of malware uploads essential for compliance.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating the use of the "Upload Malware" sub-technique include:

* **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  * This advanced persistent threat group has been observed uploading malware payloads onto compromised web servers and cloud storage services, subsequently delivering them via spear-phishing emails or watering-hole attacks. Malware uploaded includes custom backdoors and reconnaissance tools designed to maintain persistence and facilitate espionage operations.
* **FIN7 Group**:
  * FIN7 attackers have used legitimate cloud storage services such as Dropbox and Google Drive to upload malware payloads, subsequently delivered via phishing emails with embedded links. Uploaded malware includes remote access trojans (RATs), credential-stealing tools, and payload downloaders.
* **Magecart Attacks**:
  * Attackers associated with Magecart campaigns have uploaded malicious JavaScript payloads onto compromised e-commerce websites, subsequently harvesting payment card data from site visitors. Uploaded malware typically involves obfuscated scripts designed to evade detection.
* **Emotet Malware Campaigns**:
  * Emotet operators have frequently uploaded malware payloads onto compromised websites or legitimate file-sharing platforms, distributing download links via phishing emails. Uploaded malware includes banking trojans, credential stealers, and ransomware payloads, causing significant financial and operational impacts.
* **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack**:
  * Attackers behind the SolarWinds breach uploaded malicious payloads onto compromised software update servers, distributing malware-infected updates to thousands of organizations globally. The uploaded malware facilitated persistent access, espionage, and lateral movement within victim networks.

In each example, attackers leveraged malware uploads as a critical step in the attack lifecycle, emphasizing the importance of timely detection, response, and mitigation of this sub-technique.

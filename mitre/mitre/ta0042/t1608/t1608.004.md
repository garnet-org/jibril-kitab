# Drive-by Target

## Information

* Name: Drive-by Target
* ID: T1608.004
* Tactics: [TA0042](../)
* Technique: [T1608](./)

## Introduction

Drive-by Target (T1608.004) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, specifically categorized under Resource Development (T1608). This sub-technique refers to adversaries compromising legitimate websites or creating malicious websites to target users who visit them. Users unknowingly become victims simply by accessing or browsing these compromised or malicious sites. This approach allows attackers to deliver malware, execute exploits, or perform reconnaissance without direct interaction from the user beyond visiting the compromised page.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Drive-by Target attacks rely on the passive interaction of users visiting compromised or malicious websites. Technical execution of this sub-technique involves several key steps and mechanisms:

* **Compromise of Legitimate Websites:**
  * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications, content management systems (CMS), or web servers to gain unauthorized access.
  * Common vulnerabilities exploited include outdated software, weak credentials, misconfigured servers, or unpatched plugins.
  * Once compromised, attackers inject malicious scripts or redirect code into legitimate pages.
* **Creation of Malicious Websites:**
  * Attackers may register and host malicious domains specifically to distribute malware or exploit kits.
  * These websites often mimic legitimate services or contain enticing content to attract visitors.
* **Malicious Payload Delivery:**
  * Exploit kits are commonly used to automatically detect vulnerabilities in visitors' browsers or plugins, exploiting them to silently install malware.
  * Malicious scripts typically leverage known vulnerabilities in browser plugins such as Adobe Flash, Java, PDF readers, or the browser itself.
  * Attackers may also redirect visitors to external malicious domains or use embedded iframes to load hidden malicious content.
* **Stealth and Obfuscation Techniques:**
  * Attackers frequently employ obfuscation techniques to evade detection, such as encoding scripts, using JavaScript obfuscators, or dynamically loading malicious payloads.
  * Malicious content may be conditionally loaded based on visitor characteristics, such as geographic location, browser type, or operating system.
* **Infrastructure and Delivery Mechanisms:**
  * Attackers often leverage Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), compromised legitimate advertising networks (malvertising), or third-party components to distribute malicious payloads.
  * Attackers may rotate domains, IP addresses, and hosting providers to evade detection and maintain persistence.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Drive-by Target attacks can occur in various stages and scenarios throughout the cyber attack lifecycle:

* **Initial Access Stage:**
  * Attackers primarily use this technique at the initial access stage to gain a foothold in the victim's environment.
  * Victims are targeted passively, requiring no explicit action beyond visiting a compromised or malicious website.
* **Mass Infection Campaigns:**
  * Attackers use popular, high-traffic websites or advertising networks to reach a large volume of potential victims.
  * Mass campaigns often distribute common malware strains such as ransomware, banking trojans, or cryptominers.
* **Targeted Attacks and Espionage:**
  * Attackers targeting specific organizations or individuals may compromise niche websites frequently visited by their intended victims.
  * Targeted watering-hole attacks leverage drive-by techniques to infect specific groups or industries.
* **Reconnaissance and Profiling:**
  * Attackers may use drive-by targeting to perform reconnaissance, gather intelligence, or fingerprint potential victims' browsers and systems for future targeted attacks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Drive-by Target attacks involves multiple layers of defense, monitoring, and analysis:

* **Website Monitoring and Integrity Checks:**
  * Regular scanning and monitoring of websites for unauthorized changes, injected scripts, or suspicious redirects.
  * Tools such as web application firewalls (WAFs), integrity monitoring solutions, and vulnerability scanners help detect compromised websites.
* **Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**
  * IDS and IPS solutions can detect suspicious network traffic, exploit attempts, and known malicious domains/IP addresses.
  * DNS monitoring and analysis for unusual domain lookups or communication with known malicious infrastructure.
* **Endpoint Protection and Browser Security:**
  * Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions can detect anomalous behavior, exploit attempts, and malicious payload execution on endpoints.
  * Browser-based security tools and plugins can block malicious scripts, detect exploit attempts, and alert users.
* **Malware Analysis and Sandboxing:**
  * Automated sandbox solutions analyze website content dynamically, detecting malicious scripts, payloads, or exploit attempts.
  * Static analysis tools identify obfuscated or encoded scripts indicative of malicious activity.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  * Suspicious or unfamiliar scripts embedded in legitimate web pages.
  * Unusual redirects or iframes pointing to external domains.
  * Known exploit kit domains, IP addresses, or malicious CDN providers.
  * Suspicious file hashes, URLs, or JavaScript snippets identified in threat intelligence feeds.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection and mitigation of Drive-by Target attacks are critical due to their severe potential impacts:

* **Rapid and Silent Infection:**
  * Users can become infected immediately upon visiting compromised websites without any explicit interaction or awareness.
  * Silent infections increase the difficulty of identifying and containing incidents, leading to widespread damage.
* **Risk of Mass Infection:**
  * Compromised high-traffic websites or advertising networks can infect large numbers of users quickly, amplifying the scale and impact of attacks.
* **Data Theft and Espionage:**
  * Drive-by attacks frequently deliver malware designed to steal sensitive data, credentials, financial information, or intellectual property, resulting in significant financial and reputational damage.
* **Operational Disruption and Downtime:**
  * Ransomware and destructive malware delivered via drive-by attacks can lead to significant operational disruption, downtime, and recovery costs.
* **Compliance and Legal Consequences:**
  * Failure to detect and mitigate drive-by attacks can lead to legal and compliance issues, especially in regulated industries, resulting in fines, penalties, and loss of customer trust.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Drive-by Target attacks demonstrating methodologies, tools, and impacts include:

* **Magecart Attacks:**
  * Attackers compromised legitimate e-commerce websites by injecting malicious JavaScript to steal customer payment card data.
  * Victims unknowingly had their credit card information stolen upon visiting compromised checkout pages.
  * Impact: Massive financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory scrutiny for affected organizations.
* **Angler Exploit Kit Campaign:**
  * Attackers leveraged the Angler Exploit Kit hosted on compromised websites and malicious advertisements to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Java.
  * Upon exploitation, malware such as ransomware, banking trojans, and credential stealers were silently installed on victims' systems.
  * Impact: Significant financial losses, data breaches, and operational disruption.
* **NotPetya Attack:**
  * Attackers compromised legitimate websites and software update mechanisms of a widely-used Ukrainian accounting software (M.E.Doc).
  * Victims visiting the compromised update site unknowingly downloaded and executed malicious payloads.
  * Impact: Global operational disruption, billions of dollars in financial damage, and extensive recovery efforts.
* **Watering-Hole Attacks on Aerospace and Defense Sector:**
  * Attackers compromised websites frequently visited by employees in the aerospace and defense industries.
  * Drive-by downloads silently installed espionage malware to steal sensitive intellectual property and classified information.
  * Impact: Loss of sensitive data, intellectual property theft, and national security implications.

These examples illustrate the diverse methods, tools, and severe impacts associated with Drive-by Target attacks, underscoring the importance of proactive detection and defense strategies.

# Dynamic Data Exchange [T1559.002]

## Information

- Name: Dynamic Data Exchange
- ID: T1559.002
- Tactics: [TA0002](../TA0002/TA0002.md)
- Technique: [T1559](./T1559.md)

## Introduction

Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) [T1559.002] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework categorized under "Inter-Process Communication." DDE is a legacy Microsoft Windows inter-process communication mechanism that enables data exchange between applications. Attackers exploit DDE to execute malicious commands or payloads, often embedding them within legitimate documents or applications, bypassing traditional security mechanisms and leveraging native system functionality.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a client-server protocol enabling Windows applications to exchange data dynamically. Originally designed for legitimate purposes, attackers misuse DDE to execute arbitrary commands and scripts, typically through crafted Office documents.

Technical details include:

- **Mechanism of Execution:**

  - Attackers embed malicious DDE fields within Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, Outlook).
  - DDE fields can contain commands executed upon document opening without requiring macros.
  - Typical payloads include PowerShell scripts, command-line instructions, or downloading additional malware.

- **Execution Methods:**

  - Malicious DDE commands embedded in:
    - Word fields (`{DDEAUTO}` and `{DDE}`).
    - Excel formulas (`=cmd|' /c calc.exe'!A0`).
    - Outlook email messages (via embedded Office documents or inline DDE fields).

- **Real-world Procedures:**
  - Attackers send phishing emails containing malicious Office documents.
  - Users opening these documents trigger DDE commands, executing malicious payloads without macros enabled.
  - Attackers leverage DDE to evade macro-based security controls and endpoint protections.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly leverage DDE in various attack stages and scenarios, including:

- **Initial Access:**

  - Phishing campaigns delivering malicious documents via email attachments.
  - Spear-phishing targeting specific individuals or organizations.

- **Execution:**

  - Immediate execution of malicious commands upon document opening.
  - Download and execution of second-stage payloads such as ransomware, trojans, or backdoors.

- **Defense Evasion:**

  - Bypassing macro security settings and endpoint antivirus solutions.
  - Exploiting legitimate Windows functionality to evade detection.

- **Delivery of Malware:**
  - Deploying ransomware payloads.
  - Dropping remote access trojans (RATs).
  - Establishing persistence through additional malware downloads.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malicious Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) activity typically involves monitoring and analyzing system and network behaviors, including:

- **Endpoint Detection:**

  - Monitoring abnormal execution of command-line processes initiated by Office applications.
  - Observing unusual PowerShell or cmd.exe executions spawned from Office processes.
  - Implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to identify anomalous parent-child process relationships.

- **Email Security Controls:**

  - Scanning email attachments for suspicious DDE fields or embedded commands.
  - Blocking or quarantining Office documents containing suspicious DDE fields.

- **Network Monitoring:**

  - Identifying network connections initiated by Office processes to suspicious external IP addresses or domains.
  - Detecting unusual download patterns indicative of second-stage payload retrieval.

- **IoCs (Indicators of Compromise):**
  - Suspicious command-line arguments executed by Office applications.
  - Unusual registry changes or scheduled tasks initiated by Office documents.
  - Network traffic to known malicious domains or IP addresses following document execution.
  - Office documents containing embedded DDE fields such as `{DDEAUTO}`, `{DDE}`, or suspicious Excel formulas (`=cmd|...`).

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of malicious Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) usage is crucial due to the significant potential impacts on systems and networks, including:

- **System Compromise:**

  - Execution of arbitrary commands leading to unauthorized access and control over affected systems.
  - Deployment of malware payloads resulting in compromised data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Data Exfiltration:**

  - Attackers leveraging initial DDE exploitation to establish persistent footholds, enabling long-term data theft.

- **Ransomware Attacks:**

  - Delivery of ransomware payloads capable of encrypting critical data and causing significant operational disruption.

- **Defense Evasion:**

  - Utilizing legitimate Windows processes and functionalities, attackers bypass traditional security defenses, complicating detection and remediation efforts.

- **Operational Impact:**
  - Organizations may experience downtime, financial losses, and reputational damage resulting from successful DDE-based attacks.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating malicious Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) usage include:

- **Necurs Botnet Campaign (2017):**

  - Attackers leveraged DDE fields embedded in Microsoft Word documents delivered via spam emails.
  - Upon opening, documents executed PowerShell scripts downloading malware payloads, including Locky ransomware.
  - Significant impact included widespread ransomware infections and data loss for affected organizations.

- **FIN7 Cybercrime Group Attacks:**

  - FIN7 utilized DDE-based documents in targeted spear-phishing campaigns against financial institutions.
  - Malicious Excel documents contained embedded DDE formulas executing command-line instructions to download and install Carbanak malware.
  - Resulted in financial theft and data breaches impacting multiple banks and financial entities.

- **Hancitor Malware Distribution:**

  - Attackers distributed malicious Word documents containing DDE fields via phishing emails.
  - Documents executed cmd.exe commands downloading and executing the Hancitor malware payload.
  - Hancitor subsequently deployed secondary payloads such as banking trojans and ransomware.

- **APT28 (Fancy Bear) Campaigns:**
  - Russian-linked threat actor APT28 utilized DDE techniques in spear-phishing campaigns targeting government and military entities.
  - Malicious Office documents executed PowerShell commands retrieving further malware payloads.
  - Resulted in espionage activities and unauthorized data exfiltration from targeted organizations.

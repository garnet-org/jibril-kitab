# Exploits

## Information

- Name: Exploits
- ID: T1588.005
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1588](T1588.md)

## Introduction

Exploits ([T1588.005](techniques/T1588.005.md)) is a sub-technique within MITRE ATT\&CK's broader category of Obtain Capabilities (T1588). This specific sub-technique represents adversaries acquiring and leveraging exploits—code or methods specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities within software, firmware, or hardware—to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or disrupt systems. Exploits are often critical tools in an adversary's toolkit, enabling them to bypass security controls, evade detection, and accomplish their objectives efficiently.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Exploits ([T1588.005](techniques/T1588.005.md)) typically involve leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targeted systems. A detailed exploration of this sub-technique includes:

- **Types of Exploits:**
  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands or code remotely without prior authentication.
  - **Privilege Escalation Exploits:** Used to gain higher privileges on a compromised system, enabling further lateral movement and persistence.
  - **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Exploits:** Designed to disrupt availability of targeted systems or services.
  - **Web Application Exploits:** Target vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
  - **Buffer Overflow and Memory Corruption Exploits:** Exploit software vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code or cause system crashes.
- **Sources of Exploits:**
  - Public exploit databases (Exploit-DB, Packet Storm Security)
  - Dark web forums and marketplaces
  - GitHub repositories and open-source exploit frameworks (Metasploit, Exploit Pack)
  - Custom-developed exploits by advanced threat actors or nation-state groups
- **Mechanisms of Exploitation:**
  - Delivery via phishing emails, malicious attachments, or links
  - Exploitation of internet-facing services exposed without proper patching
  - Exploiting trust relationships between internal systems (lateral movement)
  - Leveraging compromised credentials or authentication bypass exploits
- **Real-world Procedures:**
  - Initial reconnaissance to identify vulnerable software or services
  - Weaponization and customization of publicly available exploits
  - Deployment of exploit payloads through automated frameworks or manual interaction
  - Post-exploitation activities such as persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Exploits ([T1588.005](techniques/T1588.005.md)) are utilized at multiple stages of the cyber attack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly exposed services (web servers, VPN gateways, email servers)
  - Leveraging browser-based exploits delivered via malicious websites or phishing campaigns
- **Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
  - Privilege escalation exploits to gain administrative or root-level privileges after initial compromise
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems or middleware to execute malicious payloads
- **Lateral Movement:**
  - Exploiting internal systems and services to move laterally within a compromised network environment
  - Targeting vulnerabilities in internal infrastructure components (domain controllers, databases, application servers)
- **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
  - Using exploits to bypass endpoint protection, antivirus solutions, or intrusion detection systems
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in security products themselves to disable or evade detection mechanisms
- **Impact and Disruption:**
  - Deploying exploits designed specifically to disrupt critical infrastructure, cause denial-of-service, or damage systems
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in industrial control systems (ICS) or operational technology (OT) networks for sabotage or disruption

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of exploits ([T1588.005](techniques/T1588.005.md)) typically involves multiple layers of security monitoring and analysis:

- **Network-level Detection:**
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures identifying known exploit traffic patterns
  - Network behavior analysis tools detecting anomalous traffic indicative of exploit attempts
  - Monitoring outbound communications to known malicious IP addresses or domains associated with exploit delivery infrastructure
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  - Detecting suspicious process behavior, memory injections, or privilege escalation attempts
  - Identifying anomalous file or registry modifications associated with exploit payloads
  - Monitoring system logs for abnormal access patterns or unauthorized privilege escalations
- **Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management:**
  - Regularly scanning assets to identify vulnerabilities targeted by known exploits
  - Correlating vulnerability scan results with exploit attempt logs to prioritize responses
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
  - Aggregating logs from network devices, servers, and endpoints to detect and correlate exploit-related activities
  - Alerting on suspicious or anomalous events indicative of exploit attempts or successful exploitation
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Known exploit signatures and payload hashes
  - URLs, IP addresses, and domains associated with exploit campaigns
  - Suspicious file artifacts (scripts, binaries, payloads) identified post-exploitation

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of exploits ([T1588.005](techniques/T1588.005.md)) is critical to minimize potential damage and avoid significant impacts, including:

- **System Compromise and Data Breach:**
  - Exploits often lead directly to unauthorized access, enabling attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:**
  - Early detection prevents attackers from escalating privileges and moving laterally, limiting the scope and impact of the compromise.
- **Operational Disruption:**
  - Exploits targeting critical infrastructure or operational technology can cause severe disruption, downtime, and financial losses.
- **Reputational Damage:**
  - Successful exploitation leading to breaches or disruptions can significantly harm an organization's reputation and customer trust.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Consequences:**
  - Failure to detect and mitigate exploits can result in regulatory penalties, legal liabilities, and compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
- **Early Response and Mitigation:**
  - Prompt detection allows security teams to rapidly respond, contain incidents, remediate vulnerabilities, and prevent further exploitation.

## Examples

Real-world examples of exploits ([T1588.005](techniques/T1588.005.md)) in cyber attacks include:

- **EternalBlue (MS17-010):**

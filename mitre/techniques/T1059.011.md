## Information

- Name: Lua
- ID: T1059.011
- Tactics: [TA0002](../TA0002/TA0002.md)
- Technique: [T1059](T1059.md)

## Introduction

Lua \[T1059.011] is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique (T1059). Attackers leverage Lua scripting language to execute malicious scripts, automate tasks, and facilitate command execution during intrusion activities. Lua is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language widely used across various applications, games, and embedded systems, making it an attractive target for adversaries seeking stealthy and flexible execution methods.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Lua scripting provides attackers with a versatile method for executing arbitrary code, performing reconnaissance, and automating malicious actions. Attackers may exploit Lua scripts embedded within legitimate software or leverage Lua interpreters installed on compromised systems.

Technical details and execution mechanisms include:

- **Embedding Malicious Lua Scripts:** Attackers insert malicious Lua scripts into legitimate applications or services that support Lua scripting, exploiting their built-in interpreters.
- **Standalone Lua Interpreter:** Attackers may upload and execute standalone Lua interpreters on compromised hosts, allowing them full control over script execution without relying on external dependencies.
- **Lua Libraries and Modules:** Lua scripts can import external modules and libraries, enabling attackers to extend capabilities such as network communication, file manipulation, or system enumeration.
- **Obfuscation and Encoding:** Malicious Lua scripts may be obfuscated or encoded to evade detection and complicate analysis.
- **Persistence and Automation:** Lua scripts can be configured to execute automatically upon system reboot or application startup, providing attackers with persistent access to compromised systems.

Real-world procedures involve attackers embedding Lua scripts within popular gaming platforms, IoT devices, or network appliances, exploiting their native Lua scripting capabilities to execute malicious payloads or establish backdoors.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly use Lua scripting in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

- **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or IoT devices that support Lua scripting.
  - Embedding malicious Lua scripts into legitimate software updates or plugins.
- **Execution and Command Control:**
  - Using Lua scripts for arbitrary command execution and automated tasks on compromised hosts.
  - Leveraging Lua interpreters for interactive command shells or remote control.
- **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
  - Establishing persistent backdoors by embedding Lua scripts within startup routines or scheduled tasks.
  - Exploiting Lua-based scripting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or bypass security controls.
- **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:**
  - Enumerating system information, network topology, and security configurations using Lua scripts.
  - Automating lateral movement through Lua scripts embedded within applications deployed across multiple hosts.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malicious Lua scripting activities involves monitoring and analyzing various indicators of compromise (IoCs), system behaviors, and configurations:

- **Monitoring File System and File Integrity:**
  - Detecting unauthorized or unusual Lua script files (.lua extension) appearing in sensitive directories or system paths.
  - Identifying unexpected modifications or additions to existing Lua scripts within legitimate applications.
- **Process and Command Line Monitoring:**
  - Observing execution of Lua interpreters (lua.exe, luac.exe) with unusual parameters or from suspicious locations.
  - Detecting command-line arguments indicative of malicious Lua scripts execution.
- **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:**
  - Identifying anomalous network communication patterns initiated by Lua scripts.
  - Monitoring unexpected file system changes, registry modifications, or scheduled tasks initiated by Lua scripts.
- **Log Analysis and Auditing:**
  - Reviewing application logs for unusual Lua script execution or errors.
  - Inspecting system logs for unauthorized access or execution attempts involving Lua interpreters.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**
  - Leveraging advanced detection capabilities provided by EDR tools to identify suspicious Lua interpreter activities and script executions.
  - Employing threat hunting techniques focusing on Lua script usage across endpoints.

Specific IoCs include:

- Presence of unusual Lua scripts in temporary directories or hidden folders.
- Lua interpreter binaries located in non-standard or suspicious directories.
- Suspicious command-line arguments passed to Lua interpreters.
- Network connections initiated by Lua scripts to unknown or malicious IP addresses and domains.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of malicious Lua scripting is critical due to its potential impacts on systems and networks, including:

- **Persistence and Stealth:** Lua scripts enable attackers to establish long-term presence, leveraging legitimate scripting capabilities to avoid detection and maintain stealth.
- **Privilege Escalation and System Compromise:** Malicious Lua scripts can exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, leading to privilege escalation and further system compromise.
- **Data Exfiltration and Espionage:** Attackers may use Lua scripts to automate sensitive data collection and exfiltration, resulting in significant data loss and potential regulatory penalties.
- **Lateral Movement and Network-wide Compromise:** Lua scripting enables attackers to automate lateral movement, rapidly compromising multiple hosts within a network.
- **Difficulty in Remediation:** Malicious Lua scripts embedded within legitimate software or IoT devices complicate remediation efforts, requiring extensive analysis and cleanup operations.

Early detection and response significantly reduce the risk of extensive compromise, minimize potential impacts, and simplify incident response activities.

## Examples

Real-world examples of malicious Lua scripting attacks include:

- **IoT Malware (e.g., Linux-based IoT infections):**
  - Attackers have leveraged Lua scripts within IoT malware such as "LuaBot," which infects Linux-based IoT devices through vulnerabilities or weak credentials.
  - LuaBot uses Lua scripts to automate scanning, exploitation, and propagation across vulnerable IoT devices, establishing persistent backdoors and command-and-control infrastructure.
  - Impact: Massive IoT botnets created, enabling attackers to perform DDoS attacks, cryptocurrency mining, and espionage activities.
- **Gaming Platform Exploitation:**
  - Attackers have embedded malicious Lua scripts into gaming platforms or mods, exploiting built-in Lua scripting capabilities.
  - Malicious scripts executed arbitrary commands, exfiltrated user credentials, or installed secondary malware payloads onto gamers' systems.
  - Impact: Compromise of user accounts, theft of personal and financial information, and unauthorized access to gaming communities.
- **Network Appliances and Routers:**
  - Adversaries have exploited Lua scripting functionality embedded within network appliances and routers to execute persistent backdoors or reconnaissance scripts.
  - Malicious Lua scripts enabled attackers to maintain stealthy access, monitor network traffic, and pivot to internal networks.
  - Impact: Persistent network compromise, sensitive data exfiltration, and prolonged attacker presence within corporate networks.

These examples highlight the versatility and effectiveness of Lua scripting as a malicious technique, emphasizing the importance of robust detection and mitigation strategies.

# Exfiltration to Code Repository [T1567.001]

## Information

- Name: Exfiltration to Code Repository
- ID: T1567.001
- Tactics: [TA0010](../TA0010/TA0010.md)
- Technique: [T1567](./T1567.md)

## Introduction

Exfiltration to Code Repository (MITRE ATT&CK ID T1567.001) is a sub-technique under the broader Exfiltration category in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Attackers leverage legitimate code repositories, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, to covertly exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised systems or networks. By utilizing trusted platforms, adversaries can blend their malicious activities with normal development workflows, making detection difficult. This method exploits common organizational practices and trusted infrastructure to evade security monitoring and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers leveraging this technique typically follow several key steps:

1. **Initial Compromise and Data Collection:**

   - Attackers first gain access to the victim's internal systems through various methods such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, credential theft, or lateral movement.
   - Once inside, they identify, gather, and stage sensitive data, including intellectual property, credentials, personal identifiable information (PII), or confidential business information.

2. **Preparation of Data for Exfiltration:**

   - The collected data is often compressed, encrypted, or obfuscated to avoid detection by monitoring solutions.
   - Attackers may split data into smaller chunks to reduce suspicion and facilitate easier upload to repositories.

3. **Creation or Compromise of Code Repository Accounts:**

   - Attackers either create new accounts or compromise existing ones on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or private self-hosted repositories.
   - They may establish repositories that mimic legitimate projects, using innocuous naming conventions and descriptions to blend with normal development activity.

4. **Exfiltration of Data via Commits or Pushes:**

   - Attackers commit and push the sensitive data to the repositories using standard Git commands.
   - Data is often disguised as legitimate code files, configuration files, or documentation to evade suspicion.
   - Attackers may use automation scripts or CI/CD pipelines to streamline and obfuscate the exfiltration process.

5. **Retrieval and Cleanup:**
   - Once data is uploaded, attackers clone or download the repository from external systems under their control.
   - Attackers may periodically delete or overwrite commits to remove evidence and reduce the likelihood of detection.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ Exfiltration to Code Repository in various scenarios and stages of cyberattacks, including:

- **Data Theft and Espionage Operations:**
  - Attackers targeting intellectual property, trade secrets, or sensitive business information often choose this method due to its stealthiness and ease of use.
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Campaigns:**
  - Nation-state threat actors frequently leverage legitimate code repositories in long-term espionage campaigns against government agencies, defense contractors, or critical infrastructure.
- **Insider Threat Scenarios:**
  - Malicious insiders with legitimate access to code repositories can easily exfiltrate sensitive data without raising suspicion by embedding data within regular development workflows.
- **Supply Chain Attacks:**
  - Attackers exploiting the software supply chain may use compromised repositories to exfiltrate source code or sensitive build artifacts.
- **Post-Exploitation Stages:**
  - After initial compromise and lateral movement, attackers use this technique during the data exfiltration stage to quietly transfer sensitive data out of victim networks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of data exfiltration to code repositories can be challenging but achievable through the following methods:

- **Monitoring Code Repository Activity:**
  - Implementing alerts and monitoring for unusual repository creation, commits, pushes, or repository cloning/downloads.
  - Tracking sudden spikes in repository size, unusual file extensions, or large binary files committed to repositories.
- **Analyzing Network Traffic:**
  - Monitoring outbound network traffic patterns to known code repository IP addresses or domains.
  - Analyzing unusual upload volumes or repeated connections to external code repository services.
- **Implementing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solutions:**
  - Configuring DLP tools to detect sensitive data patterns or keywords being committed or uploaded to code repositories.
- **Behavioral Analytics and User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):**
  - Detecting anomalous user behavior, such as developers or non-developer accounts suddenly committing large volumes of data or making commits outside regular hours.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:**
  - Monitoring endpoint processes, scripts, or commands involving Git or other version control clients.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Suspicious repository names or accounts created shortly before exfiltration.
  - Commits or pushes containing encrypted or encoded data blobs.
  - Unusual Git commands or scripts executed on compromised endpoints.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of data exfiltration to code repositories is critical due to the following potential impacts and risks:

- **Loss of Intellectual Property and Sensitive Data:**
  - Undetected exfiltration can result in severe financial and reputational damage, as attackers gain access to proprietary source code, trade secrets, or confidential business information.
- **Regulatory and Compliance Violations:**
  - Organizations may face significant legal and compliance penalties if sensitive customer or employee data is leaked to unauthorized external repositories.
- **Enabling Further Attacks:**
  - Exfiltrated credentials, source code, or configuration details may be used by attackers to launch further targeted attacks, supply chain compromises, or impersonation attacks against partners or customers.
- **Difficulty in Incident Response:**
  - Late detection complicates forensic analysis, increases remediation costs, and reduces the effectiveness of incident response efforts.
- **Damage to Customer Trust and Brand Reputation:**
  - Public disclosure of data breaches involving code repositories can severely impact customer trust, market position, and overall brand reputation.

## Examples

Real-world examples of data exfiltration via code repositories include:

- **Operation CuckooBees (APT41):**

  - APT41, a Chinese state-sponsored group, has reportedly used legitimate code repositories such as GitHub to exfiltrate stolen intellectual property and sensitive business data from targeted organizations. Attackers disguised sensitive data as legitimate code commits, leveraging compromised developer accounts and repositories to evade detection.

- **Samsung Source Code Leak (Lapsus$ Group):**

  - In 2022, the cybercriminal group Lapsus$ exfiltrated and publicly leaked Samsung’s proprietary source code and internal data. The attackers used compromised developer credentials and repositories to exfiltrate and distribute stolen data, causing significant reputational and financial harm to the company.

- **Uber Data Breach (2022):**

  - In September 2022, Uber experienced a significant breach where attackers gained access to internal systems, including GitHub repositories. Sensitive internal documentation, credentials, and source code were exfiltrated and publicly disclosed, highlighting the risks of unauthorized access and data exfiltration via code repositories.

- **Insider Threat Scenario at Tesla (Attempted Attack, 2020):**
  - An insider attempted to exfiltrate sensitive data related to Tesla’s manufacturing processes and intellectual property by uploading files to personal GitHub repositories. The attempt was detected early due to monitoring and behavioral analytics, preventing significant damage.

In these cases, attackers leveraged legitimate code repositories to exfiltrate sensitive data, demonstrating the critical need for robust detection mechanisms, continuous monitoring, and proactive security measures.

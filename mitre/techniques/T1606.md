# Forge Web Credentials [T1606]

## Information

- Name: Forge Web Credentials
- ID: T1606
- Tactics: [TA0006](../TA0006/TA0006.md)
- Sub-Technique: [T1606.002](./T1606.002.md), [T1606.001](./T1606.001.md)

## Introduction

Forge Web Credentials (T1606.002) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Credential Access" tactic. Attackers utilize this technique to create or manipulate authentication tokens or credentials, enabling unauthorized access to web-based applications and services. By forging web credentials, adversaries can bypass authentication mechanisms, escalate privileges, and maintain persistent access to compromised systems.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in web application authentication mechanisms to forge credentials. This can involve multiple methods, including:

- **Cookie Manipulation:**

  - Attackers intercept, modify, or fabricate session cookies to impersonate legitimate users.
  - Techniques such as session fixation, session hijacking, or cookie tampering facilitate unauthorized access.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT) Forgery:**

  - JWT is widely used in web applications for authentication and authorization.
  - Attackers exploit weak signing algorithms (e.g., "none" algorithm) or leaked signing keys to craft valid JWT tokens.
  - JWT token forgery allows adversaries to escalate privileges or impersonate other users.

- **SAML Assertion Forgery:**

  - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is commonly used for Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions.
  - Attackers might exploit XML signature validation vulnerabilities or insecure SAML implementations to forge assertions.
  - Forged SAML assertions grant attackers unauthorized access to multiple interconnected applications.

- **OAuth Token Manipulation:**
  - Attackers may intercept or manipulate OAuth tokens to gain unauthorized access to resources.
  - Exploiting insecure OAuth implementations or token leaks can allow attackers to create forged tokens.

Real-world procedures typically involve intercepting network traffic, analyzing authentication mechanisms, and exploiting application vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

The Forge Web Credentials technique is commonly leveraged during various attack scenarios and stages, including:

- **Initial Access:**

  - Attackers use forged credentials to gain initial unauthorized access to web applications or cloud services.

- **Privilege Escalation:**

  - Forged tokens or cookies can escalate privileges from lower-level users to administrative accounts.

- **Persistence:**

  - Attackers maintain persistent access to compromised web applications by continually forging valid credentials.

- **Lateral Movement:**

  - Once attackers possess forged credentials, they move laterally across interconnected web services or cloud environments.

- **Data Exfiltration:**
  - Forged credentials enable attackers to access sensitive data stored in web applications or cloud services, facilitating data theft.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detecting forged web credentials involves multiple detection methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Detection Methods:**

  - Monitor web application logs for unusual authentication attempts or token generation patterns.
  - Analyze HTTP traffic for anomalies, such as unexpected session cookies or JWT tokens.
  - Implement monitoring for suspicious token reuse or unusual geographic logins.

- **Tools and Technologies:**

  - Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block suspicious requests or token manipulations.
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to correlate events and alert on anomalies.
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) tools to monitor and detect suspicious access patterns.

- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Sudden appearance of unusual or malformed JWT tokens or session cookies.
  - Authentication requests originating from unexpected IP addresses or locations.
  - Repeated authentication failures followed by successful authentication without legitimate user activity.
  - Tokens or cookies with abnormal lifetimes or unexpected claims.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of forged web credentials is critical due to significant potential impacts, including:

- **Unauthorized Access:**

  - Attackers can gain persistent and unauthorized access to sensitive data, applications, and services.

- **Privilege Escalation:**

  - Attackers may escalate privileges to administrative levels, increasing the severity of potential damage.

- **Data Breach and Exfiltration:**

  - Sensitive information, including personal data, intellectual property, or financial records, can be stolen.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Violations:**

  - Undetected credential forgery can lead to breaches of regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), resulting in legal and financial penalties.

- **Reputation Damage:**
  - Organizations experiencing credential forgery incidents suffer damage to customer trust and brand reputation.

Early detection enables rapid incident response, minimizing potential damage and preventing further exploitation.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Forge Web Credentials include:

- **JWT "None" Algorithm Vulnerability:**

  - Attackers exploited JWT implementations configured to accept tokens signed with the "none" algorithm.
  - By crafting JWT tokens without proper signatures, attackers gained administrative access to vulnerable web applications.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

- **Golden SAML Attack (APT29):**

  - Advanced Persistent Threat (APT29) leveraged forged SAML assertions to compromise cloud-based environments.
  - Attackers obtained the private key used for signing SAML tokens, enabling them to create valid assertions.
  - Impact: Persistent and undetected access to cloud services, extensive data theft, and lateral movement within victim networks.

- **OAuth Token Theft (GitHub OAuth Incident):**

  - Attackers compromised OAuth tokens through third-party integrations.
  - Forged OAuth tokens allowed attackers unauthorized access to private repositories and sensitive data.
  - Impact: Data exposure, intellectual property theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

- **Session Hijacking via Cookie Forgery:**
  - Attackers intercepted session cookies transmitted over insecure channels or through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - Forged cookies enabled attackers to impersonate legitimate users, accessing sensitive user data and functionalities.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to user accounts, data theft, and potential account compromise.

These examples illustrate the criticality of robust authentication mechanisms and continuous monitoring to detect and mitigate forged web credential attacks.

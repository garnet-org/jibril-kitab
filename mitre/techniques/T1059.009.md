# Cloud API [T1059.009]

## Information

- Name: Cloud API
- ID: T1059.009
- Tactics: [TA0002](../TA0002/TA0002.md)
- Technique: [T1059](./T1059.md)

## Introduction

Cloud API (T1059.009) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Execution tactic, specifically categorized under Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059). This sub-technique involves adversaries leveraging cloud-based application programming interfaces (APIs) to execute commands, scripts, or malicious code remotely. Attackers exploit cloud APIs provided by cloud service providers (CSPs) or other cloud-based platforms to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, persist within compromised environments, or exfiltrate sensitive data. The increasing adoption of cloud infrastructure by organizations makes understanding and detecting this technique critical for security teams.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Cloud APIs provide a standardized method for managing and interacting with cloud resources, allowing authenticated users to perform operations remotely. Attackers exploit these legitimate APIs to execute unauthorized commands and scripts, blending malicious activity with legitimate cloud operations.

Technical details and execution methods include:

- **API Authentication and Authorization Abuse:**

  - Attackers may acquire or compromise API keys, OAuth tokens, or credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
  - Once authenticated, attackers can execute commands via cloud APIs, often bypassing traditional perimeter defenses.

- **Command Execution via Cloud APIs:**

  - Attackers leverage cloud provider command-line interfaces (CLIs) or software development kits (SDKs) to run scripts or commands remotely.
  - Malicious actors may perform actions such as creating or modifying cloud instances, deploying malicious containers, or manipulating cloud storage.

- **Automated Scripting and Tooling:**

  - Attackers often use automated scripts or custom-developed tools to interact with cloud APIs at scale, rapidly executing commands or deploying malicious infrastructure.
  - Common scripting languages and tools include Python scripts, Bash scripts, PowerShell scripts, Terraform, AWS CLI, Azure CLI, and Google Cloud SDK.

- **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**

  - Attackers may use cloud APIs to create persistent backdoors, such as unauthorized user accounts, roles, or permissions.
  - Privilege escalation can be achieved by modifying IAM policies or roles via cloud APIs to grant elevated permissions.

- **Exfiltration and Data Manipulation:**
  - Attackers may leverage cloud APIs to access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in cloud storage or databases.
  - APIs can also be used to manipulate or delete data, potentially causing significant operational disruption or data loss.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique can appear across various stages of an attack lifecycle, including initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and exfiltration. Common scenarios include:

- **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
  - Attackers identify exposed or misconfigured cloud APIs during reconnaissance and exploit these to gain initial foothold.
- **Execution and Deployment:**
  - Attackers execute commands or deploy malicious payloads directly via cloud APIs, often automating these actions through scripts or tools.
- **Persistence:**
  - Creation of unauthorized cloud accounts, roles, or API keys to maintain persistent access.
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Modifying or abusing IAM policies and roles through cloud APIs to escalate privileges within cloud environments.
- **Lateral Movement:**
  - Utilizing cloud APIs to pivot between cloud resources or services within the compromised environment.
- **Data Exfiltration:**
  - Leveraging cloud APIs to access sensitive data stored in cloud storage, databases, or application services, and subsequently exfiltrating data.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Cloud API abuse involves monitoring, analyzing, and correlating cloud service logs, network traffic, and API usage data. Common detection methods and tools include:

- **Cloud Provider Logging and Monitoring:**

  - AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, Google Cloud Audit Logs, and other CSP logging mechanisms provide detailed API request logs.
  - Monitoring for abnormal or unexpected API calls, especially from unfamiliar IP addresses, regions, or user accounts.

- **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection:**

  - Employ behavioral analytics tools and SIEM solutions (such as Splunk, ELK Stack, Azure Sentinel, AWS GuardDuty) to detect anomalous patterns in API usage.
  - Identify unusual spikes in API activity, access from unusual geographical locations, or API calls outside normal business hours.

- **API Credential Monitoring:**

  - Monitor usage patterns of API keys and OAuth tokens to detect suspicious activity, such as excessive or unauthorized API calls.
  - Regularly audit and rotate API keys and credentials to minimize exposure.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**

  - Unexpected creation or modification of cloud resources (virtual machines, containers, storage buckets, IAM roles).
  - API calls associated with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - Unusual API call patterns, including repeated failed authentication attempts or access to sensitive resources without legitimate need.

- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Tools:**
  - Utilize CSPM solutions (e.g., Prisma Cloud, Aqua Security, Orca Security) to continuously monitor cloud environments for misconfigurations and suspicious API interactions.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Cloud API abuse is critical due to the potential impacts on organizations, including:

- **Unauthorized Access and Data Breach:**

  - Attackers leveraging cloud APIs can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

- **Persistence and Difficulty of Remediation:**

  - Attackers may establish persistent footholds by creating hidden accounts or roles, complicating remediation and recovery efforts.

- **Privilege Escalation and Expanded Attack Surface:**

  - Abuse of cloud APIs can enable attackers to escalate privileges, increasing their control over cloud infrastructure and resources.

- **Financial and Operational Impact:**

  - Malicious API usage can result in unauthorized creation or manipulation of cloud resources, leading to increased cloud costs, operational disruption, or data loss.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Risks:**
  - Failure to detect and mitigate cloud API abuse can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, or other industry-specific standards.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Cloud API (T1059.009) abuse include:

- **Capital One Data Breach (2019):**

  - Attacker exploited a misconfigured AWS IAM role and leveraged AWS APIs to access and exfiltrate over 100 million customer records stored in AWS S3 buckets.
  - Tools and methods used: AWS CLI, EC2 instance metadata service exploitation, and AWS API calls for data extraction.

- **TeamTNT Cloud Attacks:**

  - Attackers utilized compromised Docker APIs and cloud provider APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining malware on cloud infrastructure.
  - Tools and methods used: Automated scripts, Docker API exploitation, AWS credential harvesting, and malicious container deployment via cloud APIs.

- **Rocke Group Cloud API Abuse:**

  - Rocke threat actors leveraged cloud APIs to deploy malicious cryptocurrency miners and backdoors in cloud environments.
  - Tools and methods used: Custom scripts and malware, exploitation of cloud API credentials, and malicious cloud instance creation.

- **Misconfigured Kubernetes APIs:**

  - Attackers exploited exposed Kubernetes APIs to execute unauthorized commands, deploy malicious containers, and move laterally within cloud environments.
  - Tools and methods used: Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`), cloud provider APIs, and automated exploitation scripts.

- **Azure OAuth Token Abuse (Nobelium attacks):**
  - Attackers compromised OAuth tokens and used Azure APIs to access sensitive email accounts and cloud resources during the SolarWinds-related Nobelium campaign.
  - Tools and methods used: Compromised OAuth tokens, Azure APIs, Microsoft Graph API for data access and exfiltration.

These examples illustrate the significant risks associated with Cloud API abuse and emphasize the importance of proactive detection, monitoring, and response strategies.

# Wireless Network Discovery

## Information

- Name: Cloud Instance Metadata API
- ID: T1522
- Tactics: [TA0006](../TA0006/TA0006.md)

## Introduction

Wireless Network Discovery (Technique ID: T1046) is classified under the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. Adversaries utilize this technique to identify wireless networks available within target environments. By discovering wireless networks, attackers can gain insights into potential entry points, network topology, and exploitable wireless infrastructure. This reconnaissance activity typically precedes further intrusive actions, such as gaining unauthorized access or lateral movement within a compromised network.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Wireless Network Discovery involves adversaries systematically scanning for wireless access points (APs) and network infrastructure. The primary goal is to identify wireless networks that can be exploited or leveraged for further malicious activities.

Technical execution methods include:

- **Passive Scanning:**
  - Listening passively to beacon frames broadcasted by wireless access points.
  - Capturing SSIDs, MAC addresses, channel information, encryption types, and signal strength.
  - Tools often used: Kismet, Aircrack-ng suite (airodump-ng), Wireshark.
- **Active Scanning:**
  - Sending probe requests to prompt responses from available wireless networks.
  - Actively enumerating hidden SSIDs and identifying APs that do not broadcast openly.
  - Tools often used: NetStumbler, Aircrack-ng suite (aireplay-ng), iwlist, WiFi Pineapple.

Commonly collected information includes:

- SSID (network name)
- BSSID (MAC address of AP)
- Encryption and authentication methods (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3, Enterprise authentication)
- Signal strength and channel information
- Vendor/manufacturer details (via MAC address OUI lookup)

Real-world procedures and mechanisms:

- Attackers may physically approach targeted locations to perform wireless reconnaissance.
- Usage of specialized hardware (e.g., long-range antennas, high-gain adapters) to extend scanning range.
- Automated scripts and tools to rapidly collect and organize wireless network data.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ Wireless Network Discovery during several stages of an attack lifecycle, notably:

- **Initial Reconnaissance:**
  - Identifying vulnerable networks prior to launching attacks or attempting unauthorized connections.
  - Mapping wireless infrastructure to select optimal entry points.
- **Initial Access:**
  - Discovering misconfigured or weakly secured wireless networks for initial foothold.
  - Targeting guest networks or rogue APs for unauthorized access.
- **Persistence and Lateral Movement:**
  - After initial compromise, mapping additional wireless networks that may facilitate lateral movement.
  - Identifying alternate network paths or redundant wireless infrastructure for persistent access.
- **Exfiltration and Command-and-Control:**
  - Identifying wireless networks that can serve as covert communication channels or data exfiltration points.

Scenarios where Wireless Network Discovery is prominent:

- Physical penetration tests and red team engagements.
- Attacks targeting corporate environments with extensive Wi-Fi infrastructure.
- Espionage campaigns aiming to infiltrate secure wireless networks.
- Opportunistic attacks targeting poorly secured public or guest networks.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Wireless Network Discovery activities involves a combination of technical monitoring and behavioral analysis. Common detection methods include:

- **Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS):**
  - Real-time monitoring for suspicious wireless scanning behaviors.
  - Detection of unauthorized probe requests, rogue APs, and unusual signal patterns.
  - Tools: Cisco Adaptive Wireless IPS, Aruba RFProtect, AirMagnet Enterprise.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  - Analyzing wireless traffic logs for abnormal probe requests or scanning activities.
  - Identifying unusual MAC addresses or repeated connection attempts from unknown devices.
  - Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump, Zeek/Bro IDS.
- **Physical Surveillance and Monitoring:**
  - Observing unauthorized individuals or vehicles performing wireless scans near sensitive locations.
  - Correlating physical security logs with wireless intrusion detection alerts.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

- Repeated probe requests from unknown MAC addresses.
- Presence of rogue or unauthorized APs.
- Unusual wireless client behavior (e.g., rapid channel hopping, excessive probe requests).
- Detection of known wireless scanning tools or hardware signatures.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Wireless Network Discovery is critical due to its potential to precede more damaging cyberattacks. Importance includes:

- **Preventing Unauthorized Access:**
  - Early identification of reconnaissance activities helps prevent subsequent unauthorized access attempts.
  - Enables proactive strengthening of wireless network security configurations.
- **Reducing Attack Surface:**
  - Identifying and mitigating rogue APs or misconfigured wireless devices reduces vulnerabilities.
  - Ensures wireless infrastructure adheres to security best practices.
- **Protecting Sensitive Information:**
  - Prevents attackers from gaining access to sensitive corporate or personal data transmitted over wireless networks.
  - Reduces risk of data breaches, espionage, and intellectual property theft.
- **Maintaining Network Integrity and Availability:**
  - Detecting suspicious wireless activities helps prevent network disruptions or denial-of-service attacks.
  - Protects legitimate wireless users and maintains network reliability.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:**
  - Many regulatory frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) require monitoring and protection of wireless networks.
  - Early detection helps maintain compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating Wireless Network Discovery include:

- **Operation Aurora (2010):**
  - Attackers conducted extensive wireless reconnaissance against targeted companies to identify vulnerable wireless networks.
  - Tools used: Aircrack-ng suite, custom scripts.
  - Impact: Successful infiltration of corporate networks, theft of intellectual property, and sensitive emails.
- **FIN7 Group Attacks (2017â€“2018):**
  - Cybercriminal group performed wireless reconnaissance around retail and hospitality establishments.
  - Tools used: WiFi Pineapple, NetStumbler, Kismet.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to POS systems, theft of payment card data, significant financial losses.
- **APT28 (Fancy Bear) Espionage Campaigns:**
  - Advanced persistent threat group known for wireless reconnaissance near government agencies and diplomatic missions.
  - Tools used: Custom wireless scanning tools, high-gain antennas.
  - Impact: Successful espionage operations, exfiltration of sensitive governmental and diplomatic information.
- **Physical Penetration Testing Engagements:**
  - Security professionals routinely demonstrate wireless reconnaissance during penetration testing exercises.
  - Tools used: Kismet, Aircrack-ng, WiFi Pineapple, custom scripts.
  - Impact: Identification of wireless security weaknesses, rogue AP detection, improved security posture.

These examples underscore the importance of understanding and detecting Wireless Network Discovery activities as early indicators of potential cyber threats.

# Cloud Administration Command [T1651]

## Information

- Name: Cloud Administration Command
- ID: T1651
- Tactics: [TA0002](../TA0002/TA0002.md)

## Introduction

Cloud Administration Command is a technique documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under tactic "Command and Control" (ID: T1651). This technique involves adversaries leveraging legitimate cloud provider APIs and command-line interfaces (CLIs) to execute commands, control compromised systems, maintain persistence, and facilitate data exfiltration. Attackers exploit trusted cloud services to evade detection, as the traffic often blends in with regular administrative activities. Due to the widespread adoption of cloud platforms, this technique presents significant security challenges and risks to organizations relying on cloud infrastructure.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Cloud Administration Command typically involves adversaries using legitimate administrative tools provided by cloud service providers such as AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud SDK, or REST APIs. Attackers may execute commands directly via these interfaces, perform lateral movement, or manage compromised cloud resources remotely.

Technical execution methods include:

- **Cloud CLIs and SDKs**: Attackers install or leverage existing cloud command-line tools on compromised hosts to manage cloud resources.
  - AWS CLI (`aws` commands)
  - Azure CLI (`az` commands)
  - Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud` commands)
- **Cloud Provider APIs**: Attackers directly interact with cloud APIs using HTTP requests, often automated via scripts or tools, to remotely execute commands, manage resources, and exfiltrate data.
- **Cloud Management Consoles**: Adversaries gain access to cloud management consoles through stolen credentials or compromised identity providers, enabling direct administration of cloud resources.
- **Automation Tools and Scripts**: Attackers frequently use automation frameworks such as Terraform, Ansible, or custom scripts to automate cloud resource management and command execution.

Mechanisms and procedures include:

- Authentication via compromised credentials, API keys, or OAuth tokens.
- Command execution to control cloud-hosted virtual machines (VMs), containers, or serverless functions.
- Modifying cloud infrastructure configurations (e.g., security groups, IAM policies) to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- Data exfiltration through cloud storage services or databases managed via cloud provider APIs.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ Cloud Administration Command in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

- **Initial Access**:
  - Using compromised cloud credentials to gain initial foothold.
  - Exploiting misconfigured cloud resources or publicly exposed APIs.
- **Execution and Persistence**:
  - Remotely executing commands on cloud-hosted infrastructure to maintain persistent access.
  - Modifying cloud configurations to create persistent backdoors.
- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:
  - Leveraging cloud administrative commands to escalate privileges within cloud environments.
  - Moving laterally by exploiting cloud IAM roles and permissions.
- **Command and Control (C2)**:
  - Utilizing cloud APIs and administrative commands to coordinate and control compromised resources.
- **Exfiltration**:
  - Using cloud storage services or databases accessed through administrative commands to exfiltrate sensitive data.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Cloud Administration Command involves monitoring and analyzing cloud infrastructure activities, logs, and behaviors for suspicious activities. Common detection methods include:

- **Cloud Provider Logs**:
  - AWS CloudTrail logs (detect unusual API calls, CLI usage).
  - Azure Activity Logs and Azure Monitor.
  - Google Cloud Audit Logs.
- **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection**:
  - Identifying unusual patterns of administrative activity, such as execution of unexpected commands or API calls.
  - Monitoring for abnormal access times, locations, or unusually large data transfers.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Monitoring**:
  - Detecting unusual IAM policy modifications or privilege escalation attempts.
  - Monitoring for the creation of new IAM users, roles, or API keys.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  - Detecting installation or execution of cloud CLIs or SDKs on compromised endpoints.
  - Monitoring suspicious command-line executions or scripts.
- **Network Monitoring and Analysis**:
  - Identifying unusual outbound connections to cloud provider endpoints.
  - Monitoring for abnormal network traffic patterns or data exfiltration attempts.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

- Unusual or unauthorized CLI/API calls (e.g., `aws sts get-caller-identity`, `az account list`).
- Suspicious IAM policy changes, such as overly permissive roles.
- Unexpected cloud resource creation or deletion (e.g., EC2 instances, Lambda functions, storage buckets).
- Anomalous data transfer volumes or patterns to cloud storage.
- Cloud CLI tools installed on unexpected hosts or locations.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of Cloud Administration Command is critical due to the potential severe impacts on organizations utilizing cloud infrastructure. Possible impacts include:

- **Data Breach and Exfiltration**:
  - Attackers can easily export sensitive data stored in cloud services.
  - Loss of intellectual property, customer data, or confidential information.
- **Resource Hijacking and Abuse**:
  - Unauthorized usage of cloud resources leading to increased costs.
  - Use of compromised cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes such as crypto-mining or denial-of-service attacks.
- **Persistence and Stealth**:
  - Attackers establish persistent access by modifying cloud infrastructure configurations, making detection and remediation challenging.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Risks**:
  - Unauthorized access and data leaks can result in regulatory fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage.
- **Operational Disruption**:
  - Attackers may disrupt services by modifying or deleting critical cloud resources.
  - Potential downtime and loss of business continuity.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating Cloud Administration Command include:

- **Capital One Data Breach (2019)**:

  - Attack Scenario: Attacker exploited a misconfigured firewall and executed AWS CLI commands to access sensitive data stored in AWS S3 buckets.
  - Tools Used: AWS CLI commands (`aws s3 sync` and `aws sts assume-role`).
  - Impact: Exfiltration of personal data of over 100 million customers, resulting in significant reputational damage and regulatory penalties.

- **TeamTNT Cloud Attacks (2020-2021)**:

  - Attack Scenario: Attackers scanned for exposed Docker APIs and Kubernetes clusters, then executed cloud administration commands to deploy cryptomining malware and exfiltrate cloud credentials.
  - Tools Used: AWS CLI, Docker APIs, Kubernetes commands, custom scripts.
  - Impact: Unauthorized resource usage, increased cloud costs, data exfiltration, and compromised cloud credentials.

- **Rocke Group Cloud Infrastructure Attacks**:

  - Attack Scenario: Attackers exploited vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in cloud environments, executed commands via cloud provider APIs and CLIs, and installed cryptomining malware.
  - Tools Used: AWS CLI, Azure CLI, custom scripts.
  - Impact: Increased cloud resource usage, financial loss, and compromised infrastructure.

- **Tesla Kubernetes Incident (2018)**:
  - Attack Scenario: Attackers gained access to Teslaâ€™s Kubernetes console, used cloud administrative commands to deploy cryptomining malware on AWS infrastructure.
  - Tools Used: Kubernetes administrative commands, AWS CLI.
  - Impact: Unauthorized use of cloud resources, increased operational costs, and potential reputational damage.

These examples highlight attackers' frequent use of Cloud Administration Command techniques to exploit cloud infrastructure, emphasizing the importance of detection, mitigation, and secure configuration practices.

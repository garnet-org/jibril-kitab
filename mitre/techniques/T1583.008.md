# Malvertising

## Information

- Name: Malvertising
- ID: T1583.008
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1583](T1583.md)

## Introduction

Malvertising (T1583.008) is a sub-technique under the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under Initial Access. Malvertising refers to malicious advertising, where attackers leverage legitimate online advertising networks to distribute malware, exploit vulnerabilities, or redirect users to malicious websites. This approach is highly effective due to the widespread trust users and websites place in advertising networks, thus enabling attackers to infiltrate systems discreetly and broadly.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Malvertising involves embedding malicious scripts or payloads within legitimate online advertisements. Attackers typically achieve this through the following methods:

- **Ad Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code directly into legitimate advertisements served by trusted ad networks. This can occur through compromised ad servers or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the ad-serving infrastructure.
- **Redirects and Exploit Kits:** Malicious advertisements often redirect users to attacker-controlled domains hosting exploit kits. These kits scan the user's system for vulnerabilities in browsers, plugins, or operating systems, subsequently deploying malware payloads.
- **Drive-by Downloads:** Attackers leverage malvertising to initiate drive-by downloads, where malware is automatically downloaded and executed on users' systems without explicit user interaction, often exploiting browser or plugin vulnerabilities.
- **Impersonation of Legitimate Brands:** Attackers may create convincing advertisements mimicking reputable brands or services, enticing users to click and inadvertently download malware or enter sensitive information.
- **Targeted Advertising:** Malvertising campaigns can be highly targeted, leveraging ad network features such as demographic targeting, geolocation, or browsing behavior to deliver malicious ads to specific user groups or organizations.

The complexity of the advertising ecosystem makes malvertising difficult to mitigate, as attackers exploit legitimate channels and rotate malicious ads frequently, complicating detection and response efforts.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Malvertising is predominantly utilized during the initial access phase of cyberattacks, serving as a gateway for attackers to infiltrate victim systems and networks. Common scenarios and stages include:

- **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:** Attackers use malvertising to gain initial footholds, distributing malware or redirecting users to sites hosting exploit kits.
- **Mass Distribution Campaigns:** Attackers leverage malvertising to broadly distribute malware to a large audience, maximizing infection rates without targeting specific individuals.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Malvertising can be employed in highly targeted campaigns against specific organizations or industries, exploiting ad targeting features to deliver malicious payloads to intended victims.
- **Credential Harvesting and Phishing:** Attackers may use malvertising to redirect users to phishing sites designed to harvest credentials or sensitive information.
- **Botnet Recruitment:** Malvertising serves as an effective means to rapidly expand botnets by infecting numerous users simultaneously.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malvertising requires a multi-layered approach combining technical tools, analysis, and threat intelligence:

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring network traffic for unusual ad-related redirects, connections to known malicious domains, or suspicious payload downloads.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** EDR solutions can identify anomalous behaviors, such as unauthorized downloads, unexpected process executions, or exploit attempts triggered by malicious ads.
- **Web Proxy and DNS Filtering:** Utilizing web proxies and DNS filtering solutions to detect and block connections to known malicious advertising networks, malicious domains, and exploit kit infrastructure.
- **Sandbox Analysis:** Automated sandbox solutions can detect malicious payloads delivered via advertisements by analyzing downloaded content in controlled environments.
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Leveraging threat intelligence feeds containing known malicious domains, IP addresses, URLs, and indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with malvertising campaigns.
- **Browser-level Protection:** Browser security extensions and built-in browser protections (such as Safe Browsing features) can detect and block malicious advertisements and redirects.

Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include:

- Suspicious ad-serving domains and URLs
- Known malicious IP addresses and domains associated with exploit kits
- Anomalous JavaScript execution patterns within advertisements
- Unexpected redirects or pop-ups originating from legitimate websites
- Unusual file downloads or executable files initiated without user consent

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection and mitigation of malvertising are critical due to its significant potential impacts:

- **Mass Infection Potential:** Malvertising campaigns can rapidly infect large numbers of users simultaneously, resulting in widespread malware distribution and compromised endpoints.
- **Stealthy Initial Access:** Attackers exploit legitimate ad networks, making malvertising difficult to detect without proactive monitoring and security controls.
- **Financial and Data Loss:** Successful malvertising attacks can lead to ransomware infections, credential theft, and data exfiltration, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.
- **System and Network Compromise:** Malvertising can facilitate deeper penetration into networks, enabling lateral movement, persistence, and further exploitation of critical assets.
- **Erosion of User Trust:** Organizations whose websites inadvertently serve malicious advertisements risk damaging their reputation and losing user confidence, affecting overall business operations and credibility.

Early detection and rapid response to malvertising incidents significantly reduce the risk of widespread malware infections, minimize potential damages, and maintain organizational reputation and user trust.

## Examples

Several high-profile real-world malvertising campaigns illustrate the effectiveness and impact of this technique:

- **Angler Exploit Kit Campaigns:** Angler exploit kit operators leveraged malvertising extensively, infecting users through compromised advertisements served via popular websites. Victims were redirected to exploit kits that scanned browsers for vulnerabilities, deploying malware payloads such as ransomware and banking Trojans.
- **Operation Kovter:** Kovter malware, known for click-fraud and ad fraud campaigns, was distributed widely through malvertising. Attackers utilized legitimate ad networks to deliver malicious ads containing JavaScript code that redirected users to exploit kits, infecting thousands of endpoints and generating millions of dollars in fraudulent revenue.
- **Yahoo Malvertising Incident (2014):** Attackers compromised Yahoo's advertising network, injecting malicious ads that redirected users to exploit kits. This incident exposed millions of users to malware infections, highlighting the potential scale and impact of malvertising campaigns.
- **Magnigate Campaign:** Attackers utilized malvertising to distribute the Magnitude exploit kit, targeting vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Internet Explorer. Victims visiting legitimate websites unknowingly loaded malicious ads, resulting in drive-by downloads of malware payloads such as ransomware and banking Trojans.
- **Cryptowall Ransomware Distribution:** Cryptowall ransomware operators frequently leveraged malvertising to distribute malware, redirecting users from legitimate websites to exploit kits that infected systems with ransomware. These campaigns caused significant financial losses to organizations and individuals globally.

These examples demonstrate the versatility, scale, and potential severity of malvertising attacks, emphasizing the importance of proactive defense measures and continuous monitoring to mitigate this threat effectively.

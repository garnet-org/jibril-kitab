# Disk Content Wipe

## Information

- Name: Disk Structure Wipe
- ID: T1561.002
- Tactics: [TA0040](../TA0040/TA0040.md)
- Technique: [T1561](T1561.md)

## Introduction

Disk Content Wipe (T1561.002) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader category of destructive attacks known as Data Destruction. It involves adversaries deliberately overwriting or deleting data on disks to render systems inoperable, cause data loss, or disrupt business operations. Unlike encryption-based ransomware attacks, disk wiping typically aims for permanent data destruction, making recovery challenging or impossible. This sub-technique is often leveraged by threat actors motivated by sabotage, espionage, or denial of service.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Disk Content Wipe involves the intentional overwriting or deletion of critical data stored on disk drives. Attackers typically utilize specialized wiping tools, scripts, or malware capable of systematically overwriting disk sectors with random or specific patterns of data. Such operations may include:

- Overwriting Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) structures, rendering the disk unbootable.
- Utilizing built-in system commands or third-party utilities, including:
  - Windows utilities such as `cipher.exe`, `diskpart.exe`, or `sdelete.exe`.
  - Linux/Unix utilities such as `dd`, `shred`, or `wipe`.
- Employing custom malware or destructive payloads specifically designed for data destruction purposes.
- Leveraging remote administration tools or compromised administrative credentials to execute wiping operations at scale across multiple systems simultaneously.

Technical mechanisms include:

- Overwriting data sectors multiple times to ensure irrecoverability.
- Corrupting or deleting file system metadata, making file recovery difficult or impossible.
- Disabling or bypassing system protections and backups prior to wiping to maximize damage.
- Coordinated wiping operations executed simultaneously across multiple endpoints using automated scripts or scheduled tasks.

Real-world procedures often involve:

1. Initial compromise and reconnaissance to identify critical systems and data.
2. Escalation of privileges and lateral movement to gain administrative access to targeted systems.
3. Deployment of wiping tools or malware payloads via remote execution methods (e.g., PowerShell scripts, scheduled tasks, remote desktop protocols).
4. Execution of wiping commands or malware payloads, often timed strategically (e.g., weekends, holidays, or after-hours) to maximize impact before detection and response.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Disk Content Wipe is typically employed in cyber-attacks with objectives aimed at sabotage, disruption, or permanent data loss, such as:

- Nation-state sponsored cyber warfare or espionage campaigns.
- Destructive attacks intended to disrupt critical infrastructure or government operations.
- Cybercriminal attacks motivated by retaliation, sabotage, or extortion (where data is permanently destroyed rather than encrypted).
- Insider threats aiming to conceal malicious activities or cause organizational harm.
- Attacks during the final stages of a breach, particularly after data exfiltration, to cover attacker tracks or cause maximum disruption.
- Ransomware incidents where attackers threaten or execute disk wiping as additional leverage against victims unwilling or unable to pay ransom demands.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Disk Content Wipe involves monitoring and analysis of system activity, disk operations, and behavioral anomalies. Key detection methods and tools include:

- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions:
  - Monitoring for suspicious use of disk management utilities (e.g., `diskpart`, `cipher`, `dd`).
  - Detecting unauthorized execution of known disk wiping tools or malware signatures.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:
  - Alerting on abnormal administrative activity or unusual command-line executions.
  - Monitoring for mass file deletions, sudden spikes in disk I/O, or unusual disk activity patterns.
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) solutions:
  - Detecting unauthorized or unexpected changes to critical system files, boot records, or partitions.
- Behavioral analytics tools:
  - Identifying anomalous behaviors indicative of destructive malware (e.g., rapid file deletions, system reboots, or high-volume disk overwrites).
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
  - Presence of known wiping malware hashes (e.g., Shamoon, NotPetya, KillDisk).
  - Suspicious scripts or command-line arguments (e.g., `dd if=/dev/zero`, `diskpart clean all`, `cipher /w`).
  - Sudden loss of disk space or unexplained disk errors across multiple systems.
  - Unexpected system crashes or reboots following suspicious activity.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection and response to Disk Content Wipe attacks are critical due to their severe and irreversible impact on systems and organizational operations. The importance of detection includes:

- Preventing permanent data loss and minimizing downtime by interrupting the wiping process early.
- Limiting operational disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage resulting from destructive cyber incidents.
- Preserving critical business continuity by enabling rapid incident response and recovery efforts.
- Identifying and containing adversary activity early in the attack lifecycle, preventing further lateral movement or additional destructive actions.
- Facilitating forensic analysis and attribution by preserving key evidence and indicators before complete destruction occurs.
- Ensuring compliance with regulatory and legal obligations regarding data protection, incident response, and reporting requirements.

## Examples

Real-world examples of Disk Content Wipe attacks include:

- **Shamoon (Disttrack) Malware Attack (2012, 2016, 2018)**:
  - Targeted Saudi Arabian oil and energy companies, including Saudi Aramco.
  - Malware overwrote Master Boot Record (MBR) and wiped file contents, rendering thousands of systems inoperable.
  - Tools used: Shamoon malware variants.
  - Impact: Massive operational disruption, significant financial losses, and extensive recovery efforts.
- **NotPetya Attack (June 2017)**:
  - Global malware attack initially targeting Ukrainian businesses but rapidly spreading worldwide.
  - Malware masqueraded as ransomware but executed disk wiping, permanently destroying data and systems.
  - Tools used: NotPetya malware leveraging EternalBlue exploit and credential harvesting.
  - Impact: Estimated losses exceeding billions of dollars globally, severe disruption to multinational corporations.
- **Sony Pictures Attack (2014)**:
  - Attack attributed to North Korean state-sponsored actors.
  - Malware wiped data from workstations and servers, rendering systems inoperable and causing significant disruption.
  - Tools used: Custom malware designed specifically for disk wiping and data destruction.
  - Impact: Extensive data loss, leaked confidential information, reputational damage, and costly recovery efforts.
- **KillDisk Malware Attacks (2015-2016)**:
  - Targeted Ukrainian energy and financial sectors.
  - Malware wiped critical files and corrupted boot records, causing operational downtime and service disruption.
  - Tools used: KillDisk malware variants.
  - Impact: Temporary outages, data loss, and significant operational disruption to critical infrastructure.

These examples highlight the severe impacts and real-world consequences associated with Disk Content Wipe attacks, emphasizing the critical importance of effective detection and response mechanisms.

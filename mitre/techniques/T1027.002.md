## Information

- Name: Software Packing
- ID: T1027.002
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)
- Technique: [T1027](T1027.md)

## Introduction

Software Packing ([T1027.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/)) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027). Attackers utilize software packing to compress or encrypt executable files, making them harder to analyze or reverse-engineer. This technique is often employed to evade detection by antivirus software, security analysis tools, and manual inspection by security analysts. By obfuscating malicious executables, adversaries can prolong the effectiveness of malware, increase the complexity of forensic analysis, and delay defensive responses.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Software packing involves using specialized tools or utilities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise obfuscate executable binaries, scripts, or other payloads to evade detection and analysis. This sub-technique typically encompasses:

- **Executable Compression and Encryption**:
  - Attackers use packers (e.g., UPX, ASPack, Themida, VMProtect) to compress or encrypt executables.
  - Packed executables contain a decompression or decryption stub that restores the original code at runtime.
  - Original code is typically unpacked into memory, executed directly without writing to disk, complicating static analysis.
- **Obfuscation Techniques**:
  - Code-level obfuscation techniques, such as instruction substitution, control-flow flattening, and opaque predicates, can be combined with packing.
  - Packers may implement anti-debugging, anti-disassembly, and anti-analysis techniques to further complicate reverse engineering.
- **Runtime Unpacking**:
  - Packed executables unpack themselves dynamically during execution, making static analysis ineffective.
  - Analysts must employ dynamic analysis techniques, debuggers, or memory dumps to inspect the unpacked code.
- **Polymorphic and Metamorphic Packing**:
  - Advanced packers generate unique executables for each instance, rendering signature-based detection ineffective.
  - Polymorphic packers alter encryption keys or compression methods, while metamorphic packers change the executable's code structure entirely.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers utilize software packing during various stages of cyber-attacks, including:

- **Initial Access and Delivery**:
  - Malicious payloads delivered via phishing emails, drive-by downloads, or malicious advertisements often use packing to bypass antivirus detection.
  - Packed executables are frequently embedded in email attachments or downloaded from compromised websites.
- **Execution and Persistence**:
  - Malware authors pack executables to conceal persistence mechanisms, evade endpoint protection software, and maintain long-term presence on infected systems.
- **Defense Evasion and Anti-Analysis**:
  - Adversaries pack malware to evade static analysis, sandbox environments, automated malware analysis systems, and antivirus signature detection.
  - Packing is frequently combined with anti-debugging and anti-sandboxing techniques to hinder dynamic analysis.
- **Command and Control (C2) and Exfiltration**:
  - Packed malware may obfuscate C2 communications, payloads, and exfiltration routines, making network-based detection more challenging.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of software packing involves various methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Static Analysis and Signature Detection**:
  - Antivirus and endpoint detection tools scan for known packer signatures, suspicious entropy levels (high entropy indicating encryption/compression), and known packer stubs.
  - Tools such as YARA rules can detect known packer patterns and characteristics.
- **Dynamic Analysis and Sandboxing**:
  - Sandboxes and dynamic analysis environments execute suspicious files to observe unpacking behaviors, memory writes, and runtime behavior.
  - Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, FireEye, and Joe Sandbox can detect packed executables through runtime unpacking indicators.
- **Entropy Analysis**:
  - High entropy values in file sections or headers indicate compressed or encrypted content, suggesting packed executables.
  - Entropy analysis tools (e.g., PEiD, Detect It Easy, DIE, PEStudio) help identify packed files.
- **Memory Forensics**:
  - Memory analysis tools (Volatility, Rekall) can extract unpacked executables directly from memory after execution.
  - Analysts can detect unpacked code segments, strings, and APIs loaded at runtime.
- **Behavioral Indicators and IoCs**:
  - Suspicious process injection behaviors, rapid memory allocation, unusual API calls, and self-modifying code execution indicate packed executables.
  - Known packer tools or packer-specific strings (e.g., UPX headers, Themida strings) serve as IoCs.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of software packing is critical due to several risks and impacts:

- **Evasion of Traditional Security Controls**:
  - Packed executables bypass signature-based antivirus detection, enabling malware to execute undetected.
  - Delayed detection allows attackers to establish persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
- **Complexity in Analysis and Response**:
  - Packed malware complicates forensic analysis and incident response, making it challenging to identify attacker objectives, techniques, and scope.
  - Increased analysis time allows adversaries to achieve attack objectives before defensive measures are implemented.
- **Facilitation of Persistent and Advanced Threats**:
  - Advanced persistent threats (APTs) commonly use software packing to maintain long-term stealth and evade detection.
  - Failure to detect packed malware can lead to prolonged compromise, data theft, espionage, and severe reputational damage.
- **Resource Consumption and Operational Impact**:
  - Packed malware often engages in intensive resource usage, affecting system performance, stability, and availability.
  - Early detection prevents operational disruption, system degradation, and potential downtime.

## Examples

Real-world examples of software packing used in attacks include:

- **UPX Packing in Commodity Malware**:
  - Malware families like Emotet, TrickBot, and Qakbot frequently leverage UPX packing to evade antivirus detection.
  - Attackers deliver packed executables via phishing emails, enabling initial infection and subsequent payload delivery.
- **Themida and VMProtect in Advanced Malware Campaigns**:
  - Threat actors behind sophisticated malware (e.g., Dridex, Ursnif, Agent Tesla) use advanced packers like Themida and VMProtect to thwart reverse engineering and analysis.
  - These packers employ anti-debugging, anti-VM, and anti-analysis techniques, significantly complicating malware analysis and detection.
- **Polymorphic Packing in Ransomware Attacks**:
  - Ransomware operators (e.g., Locky, Cerber, Sodinokibi/REvil) use polymorphic packers that generate unique executables for each victim, bypassing traditional signature-based antivirus solutions.
  - Polymorphic packing enables rapid and widespread ransomware infections, leading to substantial financial and operational impacts.
- **APT Campaigns Using Custom Packing Techniques**:
  - Nation-state actors and advanced persistent threats (e.g., APT29, Lazarus Group) develop custom packers tailored to evade specific detection mechanisms and analysis environments.
  - Custom-packed malware allows prolonged stealth, espionage activities, and high-value data exfiltration without detection.
- **Metamorphic Packing in Banking Trojans**:
  - Banking trojans (e.g., Zeus variants, Gozi, Ramnit) employ metamorphic packing techniques to continuously alter their code structure and evade detection.
  - Such techniques enable attackers to steal sensitive financial data, credentials, and perform fraudulent transactions over extended periods undetected.

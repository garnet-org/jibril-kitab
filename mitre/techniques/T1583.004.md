## Information

- Name: Server

- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1583](T1583.md)

## Introduction

Server ([T1583.004](techniques/T1583.004.md)) is a sub-technique under the broader MITRE ATT\&CK framework's Acquire Infrastructure (T1583) technique. It involves adversaries acquiring and utilizing server infrastructure to facilitate malicious activities. Attackers leverage servers to host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, malware payloads, phishing sites, or other malicious content. Servers may be rented, compromised, or otherwise obtained to mask adversary identities, maintain persistence, and facilitate attack campaigns.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries often utilize servers as essential infrastructure components to execute and maintain their operations. The technical execution methods and mechanisms include:

- **Rental or Lease of Legitimate Server Infrastructure:**
  - Attackers frequently rent virtual private servers (VPS) or dedicated servers from legitimate hosting providers.
  - Payment is typically done via anonymous methods, cryptocurrency, or stolen payment credentials to obscure identity.
  - Popular hosting providers are targeted due to their legitimacy, high availability, and ease of use.
- **Compromise of Existing Servers:**
  - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in publicly accessible servers to gain unauthorized access.
  - Common methods include exploiting web application vulnerabilities, weak SSH credentials, or outdated server software.
  - Once compromised, servers become staging grounds for further attacks or distribution points for malware.
- **Cloud Infrastructure Acquisition:**
  - Attackers leverage cloud service providers (CSPs) such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
  - Cloud infrastructure enables quick scalability, geographic dispersion, and redundancy.
  - Attackers may abuse free trials or stolen credentials to provision cloud resources.
- **Domain and IP Address Management:**
  - Attackers use servers to host malicious domains, which are registered anonymously or through privacy-protected registrars.
  - IP addresses associated with servers may rotate frequently to evade detection and blocking.
- **Hosting Malicious Content and Infrastructure:**
  - Servers are utilized to host malware payloads, phishing pages, exploit kits, and C2 infrastructure.
  - Infrastructure often includes web servers (Apache, Nginx), databases, and scripting engines (PHP, Python).

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Adversaries utilize this sub-technique across various stages of the attack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access and Delivery:**
  - Hosting exploit kits or malicious payloads for initial compromise.
  - Serving phishing pages or malicious documents to victims.
- **Command-and-Control (C2) Infrastructure:**
  - Establishing and maintaining persistent communication channels with compromised systems.
  - Hosting C2 servers for remote access tools (RATs), botnets, or malware families.
- **Exfiltration and Data Storage:**
  - Temporarily storing stolen data before exfiltration.
  - Using servers as intermediate points to obfuscate the final destination of stolen data.
- **Persistence and Redundancy:**
  - Maintaining multiple servers to ensure redundancy and resilience against takedowns.
  - Quickly provisioning replacement servers if existing infrastructure is discovered or blocked.
- **Reconnaissance and Scanning:**
  - Using servers as platforms for scanning and reconnaissance activities to identify vulnerable targets or services.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection typically involves monitoring, behavioral analysis, and correlation of indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  - Monitoring unusual outbound or inbound connections to unknown or suspicious IP addresses and domains.
  - Detecting anomalous traffic patterns such as periodic beaconing, unusual port usage, or large data transfers.
- **Domain and IP Reputation Services:**
  - Utilizing threat intelligence feeds and reputation databases to identify known malicious servers.
  - Leveraging threat feeds from sources like VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, and Cisco Talos.
- **Log and Event Analysis:**
  - Reviewing server logs, DNS logs, firewall logs, and web proxy logs to identify suspicious or unauthorized access.
  - Monitoring for unusual login attempts, failed authentications, or unexpected administrative activity.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:**
  - Identifying connections initiated by endpoints to suspicious servers.
  - Detecting and alerting on processes or scripts attempting to connect to malicious hosts.
- **Behavioral Analytics and Machine Learning:**
  - Implementing analytics to identify anomalous server behavior, such as unexpected spikes in traffic, unusual geographic access, or abnormal protocol usage.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Known malicious IP addresses and domains.
  - Suspicious SSL/TLS certificates associated with malicious servers.
  - Known malware payload hashes hosted on compromised or malicious servers.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of adversary-controlled server infrastructure is critical due to the following impacts:

- **Data Loss and Exfiltration:**
  - Servers facilitate the exfiltration of sensitive or confidential data, leading to significant financial, legal, and reputational damage.
- **Propagation of Malware:**
  - Malicious servers serve as distribution points for malware, increasing the risk of widespread infections and compromise.
- **Command-and-Control Persistence:**
  - Servers enable persistent adversary access and control over compromised systems, allowing attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, and maintain long-term footholds.
- **Phishing and Fraudulent Activities:**
  - Servers hosting phishing content lead to credential theft, financial fraud, and identity theft.
- **Operational Disruption:**
  - Malicious servers can cause operational disruptions through DDoS attacks, ransomware distribution, or resource exhaustion.
- **Regulatory and Compliance Risks:**
  - Failure to detect and mitigate malicious infrastructure can lead to non-compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), resulting in fines and legal consequences.

Early detection and mitigation significantly reduce these risks, minimize the attacker's dwell time, and limit potential damage.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating the use of malicious server infrastructure include:

- **APT Groups (Advanced Persistent Threats):**
  - APT29 ("Cozy Bear") frequently utilizes compromised or leased servers to host command-and-control infrastructure, malware payloads, and phishing campaigns targeting government and private sector organizations.
  - APT41 has leveraged cloud infrastructure, including legitimate cloud providers, to host malware payloads and C2 infrastructure, enabling global reach and resilience against takedowns.
- **Ransomware Groups:**
  - Groups like REvil and Conti have extensively utilized rented servers and compromised infrastructure to host ransomware payloads, leak sites, and C2 servers controlling victim systems.
- **Phishing Campaigns:**
  - Massive phishing campaigns often leverage compromised servers, hosting malicious login pages mimicking banks, email providers, or social media platforms. For example, the Emotet malware campaign frequently utilized compromised web servers to distribute malicious payloads.
- **Botnet Operations:**
  - The Mirai botnet leveraged compromised IoT devices and servers to launch large-scale DDoS attacks. Servers were used as command-and-control hubs, enabling attackers to orchestrate attacks against major internet infrastructure.
- **Cloud Infrastructure Abuse:**
  - Attackers have abused cloud providers, including AWS and Azure, to provision malicious infrastructure quickly. For instance, attackers have used stolen credentials or free trial accounts to host phishing sites, malware repositories, and C2 servers.

Each example demonstrates attackers' reliance on server infrastructure to enable malicious operations, highlighting the critical importance of detection and mitigation.

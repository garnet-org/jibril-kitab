# Cloud Accounts

## Information

- Name: Cloud Accounts
- ID: T1586.003
- Tactics: [TA0042](../TA0042/TA0042.md)
- Technique: [T1586](T1586.md)

## Introduction

Cloud Accounts (T1586.003) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under the broader technique of Compromise Accounts (T1586). This sub-technique specifically involves adversaries gaining unauthorized access to cloud-based accounts, such as those hosted by cloud service providers, to achieve persistence, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. Attackers may leverage compromised credentials, exploit vulnerabilities, or employ social engineering tactics to gain access to cloud accounts, allowing them to manipulate cloud resources, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Adversaries employing this sub-technique typically focus on cloud environments due to their widespread adoption and the potential high-value targets hosted within them. Technical execution methods and mechanisms include:

- Credential Theft:
  - Phishing attacks targeting cloud account credentials.
  - Credential stuffing attacks utilizing previously leaked usernames and passwords.
  - Brute-force attacks against cloud login portals.
- Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud applications or APIs to gain access.
  - Misconfigured cloud services (e.g., publicly accessible storage buckets, weak authentication settings).
- Abuse of OAuth Tokens and API Keys:
  - Compromising OAuth tokens through malicious OAuth applications.
  - Leaking or stealing API keys from publicly exposed repositories or misconfigured environments.
- Privilege Escalation within Cloud Environments:
  - Exploiting identity and access management (IAM) misconfigurations.
  - Using stolen credentials to assume roles with higher privileges.
- Persistence and Lateral Movement:
  - Creating new cloud accounts or roles for persistent access.
  - Moving laterally between cloud services or accounts using compromised credentials.
- Data Exfiltration and Resource Abuse:
  - Exfiltrating sensitive data stored in cloud storage or databases.
  - Utilizing compromised cloud resources for cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks, or hosting malicious infrastructure.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

This sub-technique can appear at various stages of an attack lifecycle, including:

- Initial Access:
  - Attackers gain initial foothold through compromised cloud credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud services.
- Execution and Persistence:
  - Adversaries establish persistent access by creating additional cloud accounts, roles, or API keys.
- Privilege Escalation:
  - Attackers escalate privileges within cloud environments by exploiting IAM misconfigurations or assuming roles with elevated permissions.
- Lateral Movement:
  - Adversaries move laterally across cloud environments, targeting interconnected services or accounts to expand their access.
- Data Exfiltration:
  - Attackers leverage cloud accounts to access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored within cloud storage or databases.
- Impact:
  - Attackers abuse cloud resources to disrupt operations, perform denial-of-service attacks, or deploy ransomware.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of unauthorized cloud account access involves a combination of monitoring, auditing, and anomaly detection techniques:

- Monitoring and Logging:
  - Enable detailed logging for cloud account activities, including logins, API calls, and resource modifications.
  - Implement centralized logging solutions (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Audit Logs) for comprehensive visibility.
- Anomaly Detection:
  - Detect unusual login patterns (e.g., logins from unfamiliar IP addresses, countries, or devices).
  - Monitor for abnormal API usage patterns, such as excessive requests, unusual resource access, or unexpected account creations.
- Behavioral Analysis:
  - Utilize User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) tools to identify deviations from baseline user behavior.
  - Monitor for privilege escalation attempts, such as users assuming roles they typically do not use.
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
  - Unrecognized cloud accounts or roles created within the environment.
  - Unexpected API keys or OAuth tokens generated.
  - Suspicious IP addresses or user agents associated with cloud account access.
  - Unexpected spikes in cloud resource usage or billing anomalies.
  - Evidence of unauthorized data exfiltration, such as large data transfers to external IP addresses.
- Security Tools and Solutions:
  - Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) for visibility and control over cloud access.
  - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions for correlating cloud logs and alerts.
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) tools that integrate cloud telemetry.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of unauthorized cloud account access is critical due to the potential severe impacts on organizations, including:

- Data Breaches:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in cloud environments can lead to significant data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
- Financial Loss:
  - Attackers may abuse cloud resources, leading to significant financial costs associated with unauthorized resource usage (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, hosting malicious infrastructure).
- Operational Disruption:
  - Compromised cloud accounts can result in service disruption, data corruption, or denial-of-service attacks, severely impacting business operations and availability.
- Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:
  - Early detection prevents attackers from escalating privileges or moving laterally within cloud environments, limiting the scope of compromise.
- Regulatory and Compliance Implications:
  - Failure to detect and remediate cloud account compromises can result in compliance violations, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.

## Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating the use of compromised cloud accounts include:

- Capital One Data Breach (2019):
  - Attack Scenario: Attacker exploited a misconfigured AWS IAM role and firewall settings to gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
  - Tools and Techniques: Exploited AWS EC2 instance metadata service and IAM role misconfigurations.
  - Impact: Exposure of personal information of over 100 million customers, resulting in significant financial and reputational damages.
- TeamTNT Attacks on Cloud Environments (2020-2021):
  - Attack Scenario: Attackers targeted exposed Docker APIs and Kubernetes clusters to steal cloud credentials and deploy cryptocurrency miners.
  - Tools and Techniques: Credential theft scripts, cryptocurrency mining malware, lateral movement across cloud infrastructure.
  - Impact: Significant resource abuse, financial losses due to increased cloud costs, and compromised infrastructure.
- GitHub OAuth Token Compromise (2022):
  - Attack Scenario: Attackers compromised OAuth tokens issued by GitHub to third-party applications, gaining unauthorized access to cloud repositories and services.
  - Tools and Techniques: Compromised OAuth tokens, accessing cloud-hosted source code repositories.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive source code repositories, potential intellectual property theft, and exposure of cloud infrastructure details.

These examples highlight the critical importance of securing cloud accounts and implementing robust detection and response mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with this sub-technique.

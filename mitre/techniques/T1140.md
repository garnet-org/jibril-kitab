# Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information [T1140]

## Information

- Name: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
- ID: T1140
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md)

## Introduction

Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is a technique categorized within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (ID: T1140). Attackers commonly use obfuscation and encoding methods to conceal malicious payloads, scripts, commands, or sensitive information, making detection and analysis challenging. Deobfuscation and decoding are vital steps attackers perform during various stages of an attack lifecycle to reveal hidden payloads or commands prior to execution.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Threat actors frequently employ obfuscation techniques to disguise malicious scripts, executables, or configuration files. Common obfuscation and encoding methods include:

- **Encoding Schemes**:

  - Base64 encoding
  - Hexadecimal encoding
  - URL encoding
  - Binary encoding
  - Custom XOR encoding

- **Obfuscation Methods**:
  - Code minification or compression
  - Encryption using symmetric or asymmetric algorithms
  - String concatenation and splitting
  - Character substitution and transposition
  - Packing executables using tools like UPX, Themida, or custom packers

Attackers typically embed encoded or obfuscated payloads within legitimate-looking files or scripts, which are decoded or deobfuscated at runtime. Common execution methods and mechanisms include:

- **PowerShell Scripts**: Attackers often embed Base64-encoded payloads within PowerShell commands to evade detection.
- **JavaScript Files**: Malicious JavaScript embedded in web pages or email attachments often uses multiple layers of obfuscation.
- **Macros in Documents**: Microsoft Office macros frequently contain encoded commands or payloads that decode at runtime.
- **Executable Packers**: Malware authors pack executables using custom or commercial packers to evade antivirus detection and reverse engineering.
- **Scripting Languages**: Python, Perl, Ruby, and other scripting languages can dynamically decode payloads at execution time.

Real-world procedures typically involve multi-stage attacks where initial payloads are heavily obfuscated or encoded to bypass security solutions. Once executed, these payloads decode or deobfuscate themselves to reveal malicious functionality.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers utilize deobfuscation and decoding across multiple stages and scenarios in the cyberattack lifecycle, including:

- **Initial Access**:

  - Phishing emails containing encoded attachments or links.
  - Malicious macros embedded in document files that decode payloads upon execution.

- **Execution**:

  - Obfuscated scripts or binaries executed directly on compromised endpoints.
  - Encoded PowerShell commands executed via command-line interfaces.

- **Defense Evasion**:

  - Obfuscation of malware binaries to evade antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
  - Encoding malicious payloads to bypass content filtering and firewall systems.

- **Persistence and Command and Control (C2)**:

  - Encoded configuration files or registry entries that decode at runtime to establish persistent access.
  - Obfuscated C2 communications to evade network-based detection.

- **Exfiltration**:
  - Encoding sensitive data prior to exfiltration to evade data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of deobfuscation and decoding activities involves multiple approaches, including behavioral analysis, static analysis, and network monitoring. Common detection methods and tools include:

- **Behavioral Analysis**:

  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions identify suspicious decoding or deobfuscation activities at runtime.
  - Monitoring for unusual execution patterns, such as extensive use of decoding functions or unusual scripting activities.

- **Static Analysis**:

  - Antivirus or sandbox solutions detecting known obfuscation or encoding patterns within files or scripts.
  - Signature-based detection of known packers or obfuscation tools.

- **Network Monitoring**:

  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) detecting encoded payloads or abnormal traffic patterns.
  - Analyzing network traffic for encoded or encrypted data indicative of command and control communications or data exfiltration.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Presence of known packer signatures (e.g., UPX, Themida).
  - Suspicious PowerShell commands with Base64-encoded payloads.
  - Unusual registry entries or file artifacts containing encoded data.
  - Network traffic containing encoded or encrypted payloads.

Detection tools commonly used include:

- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black)
- Antivirus and antimalware solutions (Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft Defender)
- Network monitoring tools (Snort, Suricata, Zeek)
- Sandboxing and malware analysis platforms (Cuckoo Sandbox, FireEye, VirusTotal)

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of deobfuscation and decoding activities is critical due to the following potential impacts:

- **Reduced Visibility**: Obfuscation and encoding significantly reduce visibility into attacker activities, hindering incident response and forensic analysis.
- **Persistence and Escalation**: Attackers often use obfuscation to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally undetected.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Encoded or encrypted exfiltration traffic can result in sensitive data loss without detection.
- **Evasion of Security Controls**: Obfuscation techniques commonly bypass antivirus, EDR, and network monitoring solutions, allowing attackers to maintain long-term access.
- **Delayed Incident Response**: Difficulty in identifying malicious payloads due to obfuscation prolongs incident response and remediation efforts, increasing damage and recovery costs.

Early detection allows security teams to:

- Rapidly contain and remediate threats.
- Minimize potential impacts and damage.
- Improve threat intelligence and response capabilities.
- Strengthen security posture by identifying gaps in detection and prevention measures.

## Examples

Real-world examples of deobfuscation and decoding techniques in cyberattacks include:

- **Emotet Malware**:

  - Attack Scenario: Phishing emails delivering malicious Microsoft Word documents containing macros.
  - Technique: Macros decode obfuscated PowerShell commands at runtime, downloading secondary payloads.
  - Impact: Credential theft, lateral movement, and deployment of additional malware (e.g., TrickBot, Ryuk ransomware).

- **PowerShell Empire Framework**:

  - Attack Scenario: Penetration testers and threat actors executing encoded PowerShell payloads.
  - Technique: Base64-encoded commands executed via Windows command-line interface to evade detection.
  - Impact: Remote command execution, privilege escalation, and persistent backdoor access.

- **Ursnif Banking Trojan**:

  - Attack Scenario: Malicious email attachments containing encoded JavaScript payloads.
  - Technique: Multi-layered JavaScript obfuscation decoded at runtime to deliver executable malware.
  - Impact: Financial credential theft, unauthorized banking transactions, and further malware deployment.

- **APT29 (Cozy Bear) Attacks**:

  - Attack Scenario: Spear-phishing campaigns with encoded payloads embedded in legitimate-looking documents.
  - Technique: Custom XOR and Base64 encoding to conceal payloads and evade detection.
  - Impact: Espionage, data theft, and persistent access to targeted networks.

- **Cobalt Strike Framework**:
  - Attack Scenario: Advanced threat actors deploying encoded or encrypted beacon payloads.
  - Technique: Payloads encoded with Base64 or XOR encryption, decoded upon execution to establish C2 communications.
  - Impact: Persistent remote access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

These examples illustrate the widespread use of deobfuscation and decoding techniques across diverse attack scenarios, highlighting the importance of robust detection and response capabilities.

## Information

- Name: Active Setup
- ID: T1547.014
- Tactics: [TA0003](../TA0003/TA0003.md), [TA0004](../TA0004/TA0004.md)
- Technique: [T1547](T1547.md)

## Introduction

Active Setup ([T1547.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014/)) is a sub-technique within MITRE ATT\&CK's Persistence category, specifically under Boot or Logon Autostart Execution. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism designed to execute commands once per user upon logon, typically used to configure user-specific settings or applications. Attackers leverage Active Setup to establish persistence by ensuring malicious code executes automatically each time a new user logs into the compromised system.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Active Setup is a Windows operating system feature primarily intended for software configuration tasks that require user-specific settings to be applied upon initial login. It works by comparing registry keys between the system-wide (machine) and user-specific hives. If a user's Active Setup registry key does not match the corresponding system-wide key, Windows executes the associated command and then synchronizes the keys.

Technical details:

- Active Setup utilizes registry keys located in:
  - Machine-wide settings: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{GUID}`
  - User-specific settings: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{GUID}`
- Each Active Setup component is represented by a unique GUID (Globally Unique Identifier).
- The registry values typically involved include:
  - `StubPath`: Defines the executable command or script to run during user logon.
  - `Version`: Determines if synchronization between machine-wide and user-specific keys is required.
  - `IsInstalled`: Indicates whether the Active Setup component is enabled (usually set to `1`).

Attackers exploit Active Setup by inserting malicious commands or scripts into the `StubPath` registry value under the machine-wide Active Setup registry key. When a new user logs into the system, Windows detects the mismatch between the user's registry key and the machine-wide Active Setup key, causing the malicious command to execute automatically.

Common execution methods and mechanisms include:

- Executing malicious scripts (PowerShell, batch scripts, VBScript).
- Launching malware executables placed in non-standard directories.
- Leveraging legitimate system utilities (such as "rundll32.exe" or "msiexec.exe") to run malicious payloads.
- Utilizing Active Setup to execute persistence payloads that re-establish command-and-control (C2) channels or maintain backdoor access.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers typically employ Active Setup persistence during various stages of an attack lifecycle, notably:

- **Persistence Stage**: After initial compromise, attackers use Active Setup to maintain long-term access, ensuring their malicious payload executes upon user logon.
- **Privilege Escalation**: If attackers have administrative privileges, they can configure Active Setup to execute malicious commands for all new users logging into the system, potentially escalating their influence across multiple user accounts.
- **Lateral Movement**: Attackers may use Active Setup to propagate malicious code across multiple user profiles on a single compromised system, ensuring persistence even if some user accounts are cleaned or reset.
- **Defense Evasion**: Active Setup is a legitimate Windows feature, making it less suspicious to defenders and allowing attackers to blend malicious activities with normal system operations.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Active Setup exploitation involves monitoring specific registry keys and analyzing logon events. Common detection methods, tools, and indicators include:

- **Registry Monitoring**:
  - Monitor changes to registry keys under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{GUID}`.
  - Detect unexpected modifications or additions to the `StubPath` registry value.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools**:
  - Tools such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black, and SentinelOne can monitor registry changes and execution of suspicious commands during user logon.
- **Process Creation Logs**:
  - Monitor Windows event logs (Event ID 4688) and Sysmon logs (Event ID 1) for processes spawned by Active Setup during user logon.
  - Identify unusual executables or scripts launched from uncommon directories or temporary folders.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Registry entries with unusual or randomly generated GUIDs under Active Setup paths.
  - Suspicious executable paths or scripts referenced in `StubPath` values.
  - Unexpected network connections or file creations immediately following user logon events.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of malicious Active Setup activities is critical due to the following potential impacts:

- **Long-term Persistence**:
  - Attackers can maintain persistent access to compromised systems, repeatedly executing malicious payloads upon user logon without attracting immediate suspicion.
- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - Malicious Active Setup configurations can allow attackers to execute commands with elevated privileges or target multiple user accounts, increasing the scope and severity of compromise.
- **Stealth and Defense Evasion**:
  - Active Setup is a legitimate Windows feature, making malicious activities harder to detect and attribute without proper monitoring and detection mechanisms.
- **Risk of Data Exfiltration and System Compromise**:
  - Persistent access enables attackers to continuously access sensitive data, install additional malware, or pivot to other systems within the network.
- **Operational and Financial Impacts**:
  - Undetected persistence can lead to prolonged compromise, resulting in increased remediation costs, business disruption, and potential regulatory or compliance violations.

## Examples

Real-world scenarios illustrating Active Setup exploitation include:

- **APT41 (Winnti Group)**:
  - Known to leverage Active Setup persistence mechanisms to execute malicious payloads during user logon.
  - Used Active Setup registry keys to launch malicious DLL files via "rundll32.exe", enabling persistent backdoor access and data exfiltration.
- **FIN7 Group**:
  - Utilized Active Setup to execute JavaScript-based malware payloads upon user logon.
  - Inserted malicious scripts into `StubPath` registry values, enabling persistent command-and-control (C2) communication.
- **TrickBot Malware**:
  - Employed Active Setup persistence mechanisms by modifying registry keys to execute malicious payloads, ensuring the malware maintained persistence across user sessions.
- **Emotet Malware**:
  - Leveraged Active Setup to execute malicious scripts or executables upon user login, maintaining persistent foothold on infected systems and facilitating lateral movement.

Typical tools and methods used by attackers include:

- Malicious scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, JavaScript) executed via Active Setup.
- Legitimate Windows utilities (e.g., "rundll32.exe", "msiexec.exe") to execute malicious DLLs or payloads.
- Custom malware payloads specifically designed to exploit Active Setup mechanisms.

Impacts observed in these scenarios:

- Persistent remote access and control over compromised systems.
- Data exfiltration of sensitive corporate or personal information.
- Deployment of secondary payloads such as ransomware, banking trojans, or credential stealers.
- Increased difficulty in remediation efforts due to persistent footholds established via Active Setup.

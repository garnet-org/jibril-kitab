# Internal Defacement

## Information

- Name: Internal Defacement
- ID: T1491.001
- Tactics: [TA0040](../TA0040/TA0040.md)
- Technique: [T1491](T1491.md)

## Introduction

Internal Defacement (T1491.001) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under Impact techniques. It involves attackers modifying or defacing internal resources within an organization's network or systems, often to undermine trust, cause disruption, or deliver political or ideological messages. Unlike external defacement, internal defacement specifically targets internal-facing resources, such as intranet portals, internal web applications, or internal communication platforms. This type of attack may serve as an indicator of deeper compromise within the organization and can significantly affect internal operations, employee morale, and organizational credibility.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Internal Defacement typically involves unauthorized modification or alteration of internal-facing websites, portals, or communication channels. Attackers execute this technique through several methods:

- **Credential Compromise**:
  - Attackers may leverage stolen or compromised credentials, obtained via phishing, credential dumping, or brute-force attacks.
  - Once credentials are compromised, attackers access internal applications or CMS (Content Management Systems) to alter content.
- **Web Application Exploitation**:
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure direct object references (IDOR) to gain administrative access or modify internal-facing content.
  - Leveraging misconfigured permissions or outdated software to escalate privileges and modify internal resources.
- **Insider Threats**:
  - Malicious insiders with legitimate access to internal resources intentionally altering or defacing internal websites or resources.
  - Disgruntled employees or contractors may abuse their access privileges to conduct internal defacement as an act of sabotage or protest.
- **Supply Chain Attacks**:
  - Attackers compromising third-party vendors or software providers to gain indirect access to internal systems, enabling internal defacement.

Real-world procedures typically involve attackers obtaining initial access, escalating privileges, and then modifying content, images, or messages on internal websites or portals. Attackers may also embed malicious scripts or code within internal resources, potentially leading to secondary exploitation.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers may employ Internal Defacement in various stages and scenarios, including:

- **Post-Exploitation Stage**:
  - After establishing initial access and privilege escalation, attackers may use internal defacement as a method of delivering political or ideological messages, causing reputational harm, or creating internal confusion.
- **Ideological or Hacktivist Motivations**:
  - Hacktivist groups may target internal resources to deliver political or ideological messages directly to employees, aiming to influence internal perceptions or morale.
- **Insider Threat Scenarios**:
  - Disgruntled or malicious insiders may use internal defacement as a means of protest, revenge, or sabotage against their employer or organization.
- **Distraction or Diversion Tactics**:
  - Attackers may conduct internal defacement to distract internal IT and security teams, diverting attention away from other malicious activities occurring simultaneously within the network.
- **Psychological Operations (PSYOPS)**:
  - Nation-state actors may use internal defacement as part of broader psychological operations to undermine trust, morale, or confidence within targeted organizations.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Internal Defacement involves several methods, tools, and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Integrity Monitoring and File Integrity Checking**:
  - Tools such as Tripwire, OSSEC, or built-in file integrity monitoring solutions can detect unauthorized changes to web pages, internal portals, or critical files.
- **Web Application Logs and Monitoring**:
  - Analyzing web server logs, application logs, and CMS logs for unusual access patterns, unauthorized administrative logins, or unexpected content modifications.
- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**:
  - Leveraging solutions like Splunk UBA, Exabeam, or Microsoft Sentinel to detect anomalous user behavior, including unusual administrative activities or content modifications.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  - Monitoring endpoints for suspicious processes, scripts, or unauthorized access attempts using tools such as CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)**:
  - Identifying unusual traffic patterns, data transfers, or administrative access attempts from suspicious IP addresses or unusual geographic locations.
- **Specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Unauthorized administrative account creation or privilege escalation events.
  - Unexpected changes in internal web content, images, or embedded scripts.
  - Anomalous login attempts or successful logins from unusual IP addresses or at unusual hours.
  - Suspicious scripts or code embedded in internal web pages or portals.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Internal Defacement early is crucial due to the following potential impacts on systems and networks:

- **Reputational Damage**:
  - Internal defacement can severely impact organizational credibility and employee trust, especially if defacement contains sensitive, misleading, or damaging information.
- **Operational Disruption**:
  - Altered internal resources can disrupt internal communications, workflows, and employee productivity, leading to operational inefficiencies.
- **Indicator of Broader Compromise**:
  - Internal defacement often signals deeper compromise within the organization's network, indicating attackers may have broader access or control.
- **Potential for Secondary Exploitation**:
  - Attackers may embed malicious scripts or links within defaced internal pages, potentially leading to further exploitation or lateral movement within the organization.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Violations**:
  - Internal defacement incidents may result in violations of regulatory compliance requirements, especially if sensitive or protected information is exposed or altered.

Early detection allows organizations to quickly respond, minimize damage, restore services, and initiate thorough investigations to identify and remediate underlying vulnerabilities or breaches.

## Examples

Real-world examples illustrating Internal Defacement scenarios include:

- **Insider Threat Incident (Disgruntled Employee)**:
  - Scenario: A disgruntled employee with administrative privileges altered the company's internal HR portal, posting defamatory messages about company leadership.
  - Tools Used: Legitimate administrative credentials, internal CMS access.
  - Impact: Significant internal disruption, lowered employee morale, and reputational damage among employees.
- **Hacktivist Attack on Internal Portal**:
  - Scenario: Hacktivist group compromised internal-facing web application through SQL injection vulnerability, embedding political messages and propaganda onto internal pages.
  - Tools Used: SQL injection scripts, web shell access, vulnerable internal web applications.
  - Impact: Internal confusion, reputational harm, and operational disruption due to employee distraction and loss of trust in internal systems.
- **Nation-State Psychological Operation**:
  - Scenario: Nation-state-sponsored attackers compromised internal communication platform, posting misleading and demoralizing messages to employees as part of broader psychological operations.
  - Tools Used: Phishing campaigns, credential theft, lateral movement techniques, administrative access to internal communication platforms.
  - Impact: Significant internal disruption, lowered employee morale, and potential long-term trust issues within the organization.
- **Supply Chain Attack Resulting in Internal Defacement**:
  - Scenario: Attackers compromised a third-party vendor's software update, enabling unauthorized access to internal web applications, where they altered internal content and embedded malicious scripts.
  - Tools Used: Compromised software updates, web shells, credential harvesting tools.
  - Impact: Internal operational disruption, potential secondary exploitation due to embedded malicious scripts, and reputational damage.

These examples underscore the diverse methods attackers utilize for internal defacement, highlighting the importance of robust detection, response, and prevention strategies.

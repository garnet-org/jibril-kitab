# Mail Protocols

## Information

- Name: Mail Protocols
- ID: T1071.003
- Tactics: [TA0011](../TA0011/TA0011.md)
- Technique: [T1071](T1071.md)

## Introduction

Mail Protocols (T1071.003) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, categorized under the Application Layer Protocol technique (T1071). Attackers leverage legitimate email communication protocols, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, to establish covert command-and-control (C2) channels. By blending malicious network traffic into common email protocols, adversaries aim to bypass traditional security measures and remain undetected within compromised environments.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Attackers exploit standard mail protocols primarily to communicate with compromised hosts, establish persistence, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Commonly utilized protocols include:

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Typically used for sending emails. Attackers may use SMTP to send commands, receive responses, or exfiltrate data encapsulated within email messages.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**: Allows attackers to remotely access and manipulate mailboxes. IMAP can be leveraged to read commands from email messages stored on legitimate mail servers, enabling attackers to maintain persistence and stealth.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)**: Used to retrieve email messages from a mail server. Attackers may use POP3 to download instructions or exfiltrate data stored within email messages.

Technical mechanisms used by attackers include:

- **Embedding commands within email headers or message bodies**: Attackers may encode commands into seemingly benign email content or subject lines.
- **Attachments and encoded payloads**: Malicious payloads can be concealed within attachments or encoded within mail content, bypassing basic signature-based detection.
- **Encrypted email communications**: Attackers often encrypt email communications to evade detection by network monitoring tools and intrusion detection systems.
- **Legitimate mail servers as C2 infrastructure**: Leveraging trusted email services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) as command-and-control servers makes detection more challenging due to high volumes of legitimate traffic.

Real-world procedures typically involve malware or scripts designed to periodically check mailboxes for instructions, execute commands, and reply via email, creating a covert communication channel that blends seamlessly with normal network activity.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly use the Mail Protocols sub-technique during various stages of the cyber attack lifecycle, including:

- **Command and Control (C2) Stage**:
  - Establishing persistent covert communication channels between compromised hosts and attacker-controlled infrastructure.
  - Exfiltrating sensitive data through email attachments or message bodies.
  - Issuing remote commands and receiving responses via email messages.
- **Persistence Stage**:
  - Maintaining long-term access by periodically checking email inboxes for new commands or instructions, ensuring continuous communication even if other channels are disrupted.
- **Defense Evasion Stage**:
  - Concealing malicious traffic within legitimate email protocols to evade network security monitoring and intrusion detection systems.

Attack scenarios where this technique appears most frequently include:

- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns targeting sensitive corporate or government networks.
- Cyber espionage operations aiming to maintain stealth and long-term access.
- Targeted attacks against organizations with strong perimeter defenses, forcing attackers to leverage legitimate protocols for covert communication.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of malicious activities leveraging mail protocols requires a combination of network monitoring, endpoint telemetry, and email gateway analysis. Effective detection methods and tools include:

- **Network Traffic Analysis**:
  - Monitoring for unusual volumes of SMTP, IMAP, or POP3 traffic originating from endpoints that typically do not communicate directly with external mail servers.
  - Identifying anomalous encrypted email traffic patterns or unusual email destinations.
- **Email Gateway and Server Log Analysis**:
  - Reviewing email server logs for irregular access patterns, frequent authentication failures, or unexpected mailbox access.
  - Detecting unusual email message sizes, attachments, or encoded content indicative of command-and-control communications.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools**:
  - Monitoring processes and scripts accessing mail protocols or mailboxes, especially from unexpected processes or scripts.
  - Detecting unusual system behaviors, such as scripts periodically polling mail servers or sending automated emails.
- **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection**:
  - Using machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from baseline email usage patterns, such as unusual login times, email frequency, or message content.

Indicators of compromise (IoCs) specific to this technique include:

- IP addresses or domains associated with known malicious mail servers.
- Unusual email headers, such as encoded commands or suspicious attachments.
- Unexpected encrypted email communications originating from internal hosts.
- Scripts or executables present on endpoints designed to interact with mailboxes directly.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of malicious use of mail protocols is crucial due to several significant impacts on systems and networks:

- **Data Exfiltration Risks**:
  - Attackers commonly use email to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive information, intellectual property, or confidential business data, resulting in financial loss and reputational damage.
- **Persistence and Long-Term Compromise**:
  - Mail protocols provide attackers with persistent communication channels that are difficult to detect and disrupt, enabling prolonged unauthorized access.
- **Evasion of Traditional Security Controls**:
  - Leveraging legitimate and widely-used email protocols allows attackers to bypass perimeter defenses, intrusion detection systems, and basic firewall rules, complicating detection and response efforts.
- **Operational Disruption and Remediation Costs**:
  - Undetected malicious email-based C2 channels may lead to extensive compromise, requiring significant resources for investigation, containment, and remediation.

Therefore, proactive monitoring and detection of malicious mail protocol usage helps organizations minimize potential damage, reduce remediation costs, and maintain operational stability.

## Examples

Real-world examples of attacks leveraging mail protocols include:

- **Turla APT Group**:
  - Turla, known for cyber espionage activities, has utilized SMTP and IMAP protocols to establish covert communication channels. Malware deployed by Turla periodically checked compromised mailboxes for commands, exfiltrated data via email attachments, and maintained persistence through legitimate email services.
- **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
  - APT29 has employed mail protocols to communicate with compromised hosts, embedding commands within email messages and attachments. This approach allowed the group to evade network monitoring and maintain persistent access to victim networks.
- **Cobalt Strike Framework**:
  - The popular penetration testing tool Cobalt Strike includes capabilities to use email protocols (SMTP and IMAP) for covert C2 communications. Attackers have leveraged this functionality in targeted attacks to blend malicious traffic into legitimate email flows, complicating detection by security teams.
- **POSHSPY Backdoor Malware**:
  - POSHSPY malware leveraged PowerShell scripts to communicate via SMTP protocol. Commands were sent as encoded strings within email subject lines or message bodies, and responses were transmitted back through email, enabling stealthy command-and-control operations.

In these attack scenarios, adversaries successfully bypassed traditional security measures, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealth of mail protocol-based C2 channels. The impacts of these attacks included prolonged unauthorized access, theft of sensitive data, and significant operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of robust detection and mitigation strategies.

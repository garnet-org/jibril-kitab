# LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition

## Information

- Name: LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition
- ID: T1546.006
- Tactics: [TA0004](../TA0004/TA0004.md), [TA0003](../TA0003/TA0003.md)
- Technique: [T1546](T1546.md)

## Introduction

LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition (T1546.006) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the broader Persistence technique category (T1546). It refers to adversaries modifying Mach-O binaries on macOS systems by adding malicious dynamic libraries (dylibs) to the LC_LOAD_DYLIB load commands. This modification allows attackers to execute malicious payloads persistently whenever the infected binary is executed, thus maintaining persistence and potentially escalating privileges.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Mach-O (Mach Object) binaries are executable files used by macOS and iOS operating systems. These binaries can dynamically load libraries (dylibs) at runtime using load commands such as LC_LOAD_DYLIB. Attackers exploit this functionality by inserting additional LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands into legitimate binaries, causing the system to load malicious dylibs during the binary's execution.

Technical details of this sub-technique include:

- **Mach-O Binary Structure**:
  - Mach-O binaries contain headers and load commands that define how the binary loads and executes.
  - Load commands specify dependencies, entry points, and memory layout information.
  - LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands specifically instruct the operating system to load dynamic libraries at runtime.
- **Modification Methods**:
  - Attackers typically use tools such as `install_name_tool` or custom scripts to insert malicious dylib references into existing Mach-O binaries.
  - Malicious dylibs are usually placed in inconspicuous locations on the filesystem to evade detection.
  - Attackers may alter system binaries, third-party applications, or custom binaries to ensure persistent execution.
- **Execution Mechanism**:
  - When the modified binary executes, macOS automatically loads the malicious dylib into memory.
  - The malicious dylib code runs in the context of the host binary, inheriting its permissions and privileges.
  - This method allows attackers to gain persistence, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code without additional user interaction.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly leverage LC_LOAD_DYLIB addition in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

- **Persistence**:
  - Establishing persistence by modifying frequently executed binaries or system utilities.
  - Ensuring malicious code execution persists across system reboots and user logins.
- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - Modifying binaries with higher privileges (e.g., binaries executed by root or system-level processes) to escalate privileges.
- **Defense Evasion**:
  - Embedding malicious code within legitimate binaries to evade traditional security controls and antivirus detection.
  - Avoiding suspicion by leveraging trusted binaries already present on the system.
- **Initial Access and Execution**:
  - Post-compromise scenario: adversaries who have already gained initial access may use this technique to maintain long-term control over the compromised system.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of LC_LOAD_DYLIB addition typically involves monitoring and analyzing system binaries, load commands, and filesystem changes. Detection methods and indicators of compromise (IoCs) include:

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**:
  - Using tools like Tripwire, OSSEC, or built-in macOS tools to detect unauthorized modifications to system binaries.
  - Monitoring changes to binary load commands or the addition of new dylib references.
- **Binary Analysis**:
  - Analyzing Mach-O binaries with tools such as `otool`, `MachOView`, or `nm` to detect unexpected LC_LOAD_DYLIB entries.
  - Comparing known good binaries with potentially compromised binaries to identify anomalies.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
  - Utilizing EDR solutions capable of detecting suspicious binary modifications or anomalous binary execution patterns.
  - Monitoring process execution logs and binary load events for suspicious activities.
- **Behavioral Monitoring**:
  - Observing unexpected behavior of known binaries, such as unusual network connections, privilege escalations, or access to sensitive files.
  - Detecting anomalies in process behavior through system monitoring tools (e.g., Activity Monitor, audit logs).
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Unexpected dylibs in unusual filesystem locations, such as hidden directories or user home directories.
  - Modified timestamps or file hashes of system binaries, indicating unauthorized changes.
  - Suspicious LC_LOAD_DYLIB entries referencing unknown or suspicious dylib paths.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting LC_LOAD_DYLIB addition is critical due to its significant impact on system security and stability. The importance of early detection includes:

- **Preventing Persistent Access**:
  - Early detection prevents attackers from maintaining persistent access to compromised systems, limiting their ability to carry out further malicious actions.
- **Reducing Privilege Escalation Risks**:
  - Detection mitigates the risk of attackers escalating privileges by compromising high-privileged binaries or system utilities.
- **Avoiding Data Exfiltration and Espionage**:
  - Malicious dylibs may include functionalities such as keylogging, credential theft, or data exfiltration. Early detection prevents the loss of sensitive information.
- **Minimizing System Instability and Damage**:
  - Unauthorized modifications to system binaries can cause instability, crashes, or performance degradation. Detecting this technique helps maintain system integrity and reliability.
- **Compliance and Security Posture**:
  - Detecting and responding to this technique helps organizations maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and uphold strong security practices.

## Examples

Real-world examples and known attack scenarios involving LC_LOAD_DYLIB addition include:

- **XcodeGhost Malware (2015)**:
  - Attackers modified Apple's Xcode development environment by adding malicious dylib references to legitimate binaries within Xcode.
  - Developers unknowingly compiled and distributed compromised iOS apps containing malicious dylibs, leading to widespread infections.
  - Impact: Data exfiltration, remote command execution, and credential theft from millions of users.
- **OSX/Shlayer Malware (2019-2020)**:
  - Shlayer malware utilized malicious dylibs inserted into legitimate binaries via LC_LOAD_DYLIB modifications to establish persistence on macOS systems.
  - Attackers distributed malware through deceptive software updates and fake installers.
  - Impact: Persistent adware infections, browser hijacking, and unauthorized data collection.
- **OceanLotus (APT32) macOS Malware**:
  - Advanced Persistent Threat (APT32) group leveraged LC_LOAD_DYLIB additions to compromise macOS systems, embedding malicious dylibs into legitimate binaries.
  - Targeted espionage campaigns against government, media, and corporate entities.
  - Impact: Persistent espionage, data exfiltration, and reconnaissance activities.

Tools commonly used by adversaries to perform LC_LOAD_DYLIB addition include:

- `install_name_tool`: Native macOS binary manipulation utility.
- Custom scripting tools and malware frameworks designed specifically for Mach-O binary manipulation.

These examples demonstrate the severity and practical implications of LC_LOAD_DYLIB addition, highlighting the importance of proactive detection and mitigation.

# Extra Window Memory Injection [T1055.011]

## Information

- Name: Extra Window Memory Injection
- ID: T1055.011
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md), [TA0004](../TA0004/TA0004.md)
- Technique: [T1055](./T1055.md)

## Introduction

Extra Window Memory Injection (T1055.011) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, falling under the Process Injection (T1055) category. It involves injecting malicious code into the memory space of a legitimate process by leveraging extra memory regions associated with window objects. Attackers use this technique primarily to evade detection and achieve persistence by embedding malicious payloads within trusted processes, thus masking their activities from traditional detection mechanisms.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

Extra Window Memory Injection exploits the graphical user interface (GUI) infrastructure provided by operating systems, particularly Windows, to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. Windows applications often create window objects, each associated with extra memory regions allocated through APIs such as `CreateWindowEx` and `SetWindowLongPtr`. Attackers leverage these APIs to insert malicious code or pointers to malicious code into these extra memory regions.

Technical details include:

- **Extra Window Memory Allocation**:

  - Windows provides APIs (`CreateWindowEx`, `SetWindowLongPtr`, `SetWindowLong`) allowing applications to allocate additional memory for window objects.
  - This memory is typically reserved for application-specific data but can be misused by attackers to store pointers or shellcode.

- **Injection Process**:

  1. Attacker identifies a legitimate process with GUI windows.
  2. Malicious code allocates or accesses extra memory associated with the window object.
  3. Attacker writes shellcode or pointers to shellcode into the extra memory region.
  4. Attacker triggers execution by manipulating window messages or callbacks, causing the legitimate process to execute the injected payload.

- **Relevant Windows APIs**:

  - `CreateWindowEx`: Creates windows with optional extra memory allocation.
  - `SetWindowLongPtr` / `SetWindowLong`: Modifies window-specific memory values.
  - `SendMessage` / `PostMessage`: Can trigger callbacks or handlers that execute injected payloads.

- **Advantages for Attackers**:
  - Concealment within legitimate processes reduces suspicion.
  - Bypasses basic security controls and endpoint detection mechanisms.
  - Difficult for analysts to pinpoint malicious activity due to legitimate memory usage by GUI applications.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

Attackers commonly employ Extra Window Memory Injection in various attack scenarios and stages:

- **Privilege Escalation**:

  - Injecting code into processes with elevated privileges to escalate attacker privileges within the compromised system.

- **Persistence**:

  - Embedding malicious payloads into legitimate processes to maintain long-term persistence without raising suspicion.

- **Defense Evasion**:

  - Avoiding detection by standard antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, as legitimate processes are less likely to trigger alerts.

- **Credential Access and Data Exfiltration**:

  - Injected code can intercept user inputs, capture credentials, or monitor sensitive information accessed by legitimate applications.

- **Command and Control (C2)**:
  - Injected code can establish covert communication channels with attacker-controlled infrastructure, making detection and attribution challenging.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of Extra Window Memory Injection requires advanced monitoring techniques and tools, as traditional antivirus solutions may miss this subtle injection method. Effective detection approaches include:

- **Behavioral Monitoring**:

  - Monitoring processes for unusual API calls such as `SetWindowLongPtr`, `SetWindowLong`, or suspicious manipulation of window memory.
  - Identifying unexpected or abnormal interactions between processes and window objects.

- **Memory Analysis**:

  - Analyzing process memory for suspicious executable code stored in window extra memory regions.
  - Utilizing tools like Volatility Framework or Process Hacker to inspect memory allocations and identify anomalous code injections.

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:

  - EDR solutions capable of monitoring Windows API calls and correlating suspicious behaviors to alert security teams.
  - Tools such as Sysmon, CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provide visibility into suspicious API usage patterns.

- **API Hooking and Monitoring**:

  - Hooking relevant Windows APIs (`SetWindowLongPtr`, `SendMessage`, etc.) to detect unusual or unauthorized interactions.
  - Logging and analyzing API call stacks to identify anomalous injection attempts.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Unusual processes interacting with window objects of unrelated processes.
  - Suspicious memory allocations or modifications within GUI applications.
  - Abnormal window message traffic patterns (`SendMessage`, `PostMessage`) between unrelated processes.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Detecting Extra Window Memory Injection is critical due to its potential impacts on systems and networks:

- **Stealth and Persistence**:

  - Attackers can maintain long-term presence and evade traditional detection methods, significantly increasing the difficulty of threat hunting and incident response.

- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**:

  - Malicious injection into privileged processes enables attackers to escalate privileges and move laterally across networks, increasing the scope and severity of compromise.

- **Credential Theft and Data Exfiltration**:

  - Injected code can intercept sensitive data, credentials, and user interactions, leading to data breaches and unauthorized access.

- **Stability and Integrity Risks**:

  - Injected malicious code can cause instability or crashes in legitimate applications, disrupting business operations and causing service outages.

- **Regulatory and Compliance Risks**:
  - Failure to detect and mitigate such injection techniques can result in regulatory non-compliance, data breaches, legal consequences, and reputational damage.

Early detection and response to Extra Window Memory Injection significantly reduce the likelihood of advanced persistent threats (APTs), minimize potential damage, and limit attackers' ability to escalate and persist within compromised environments.

## Examples

Real-world examples and scenarios involving Extra Window Memory Injection include:

- **FIN7 Group Attacks**:

  - FIN7 (also known as Carbanak) leveraged process injection techniques, including Extra Window Memory Injection, to embed malicious payloads into legitimate GUI processes, enabling stealthy credential theft and lateral movement within targeted financial organizations.

- **Cobalt Strike Beacon**:

  - Attackers frequently use Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads to perform process injection, including window memory injection, to maintain persistence, evade detection, and establish covert C2 channels.

- **Poison Ivy RAT**:

  - Poison Ivy Remote Access Trojan (RAT) has been documented to leverage GUI window memory injection techniques to evade antivirus detection and maintain persistent access to compromised systems.

- **Metasploit Framework**:

  - Metasploit provides modules demonstrating window memory injection methods (`windows/manage/payload_inject`), allowing penetration testers and attackers to inject shellcode into GUI applications.

- **APT32 (OceanLotus)**:
  - The APT32 threat actor group has utilized advanced injection techniques, including window memory injection, to compromise targets in Southeast Asia, achieving stealthy persistence and credential harvesting.

These real-world examples highlight the practical use of Extra Window Memory Injection by threat actors, emphasizing the importance of understanding, detecting, and mitigating this sophisticated injection technique.

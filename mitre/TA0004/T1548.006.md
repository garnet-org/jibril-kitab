## Information

- Name: TCC Manipulation
- ID: T1548.006
- Tactics: [TA0005](../TA0005/TA0005.md), [TA0004](../TA0004/TA0004.md)
- Technique: [T1548](T1548.md)

## Introduction

TCC Manipulation (T1548.006) is a sub-technique within the MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorized under Abuse Elevation Control Mechanisms (T1548). This sub-technique specifically involves adversaries abusing or bypassing the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) system on macOS. TCC is a security mechanism designed by Apple to protect user privacy by controlling application access to sensitive resources, such as contacts, calendar, camera, microphone, location, and files. Attackers manipulate this system to grant unauthorized access to protected data or system resources, enabling further compromise, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.

## Deep Dive Into Technique

The Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) system utilizes a database (`TCC.db`) located in the user's Library directory (`~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`) and a system-wide database (`/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`) to track permissions granted to applications. Each database contains entries specifying authorized applications and their permissions, such as camera, microphone, or file system access.

Attackers may employ several methods to manipulate the TCC system, including:

- **Direct Database Modification:**
  - Attackers with sufficient privileges may directly modify the SQLite TCC database to insert or alter permissions.
  - This can be achieved using built-in macOS command-line tools like `sqlite3`.
  - Attackers may add malicious application identifiers or modify existing permissions to gain unauthorized access.
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**
  - Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in macOS or third-party software to bypass TCC protection mechanisms.
  - For example, exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities can grant attackers root-level access, enabling unrestricted modification of TCC permissions.
- **Social Engineering and User Interaction:**
  - Attackers may trick users into granting permissions through deceptive prompts or misleading dialogs.
  - Malicious applications can mimic legitimate software, prompting users to grant sensitive permissions unknowingly.
- **Using Malicious Scripts or Malware:**
  - Attackers can deploy malware or scripts that automate the manipulation of TCC permissions.
  - Scripts may run silently in the background, modifying permissions without user awareness.

Real-world procedures often involve attackers first establishing an initial foothold, escalating privileges, then modifying TCC permissions to facilitate further malicious actions, such as surveillance, data theft, or persistence.

## When this Technique is Usually Used

TCC Manipulation is typically employed in various attack scenarios and stages, including:

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Attackers who have gained initial access but require higher privileges or additional sensitive data access may manipulate TCC permissions to escalate privileges and expand their capabilities.
- **Persistence:**
  - Adversaries may manipulate TCC permissions to maintain persistent access to sensitive resources, even after system reboots or user logouts.
- **Data Exfiltration:**
  - Attackers targeting sensitive personal or corporate data, such as contacts, emails, camera feeds, or microphone recordings, may use TCC manipulation to bypass macOS security controls and exfiltrate data undetected.
- **Surveillance and Espionage:**
  - Nation-state threat actors or espionage groups targeting high-value individuals or organizations may manipulate TCC permissions to enable covert monitoring and data collection.
- **Preparation for Further Attacks:**
  - Attackers manipulating TCC permissions as a preparatory step for subsequent attacks, such as lateral movement, credential harvesting, or deploying additional malware.

## How this Technique is Usually Detected

Detection of TCC Manipulation involves monitoring system activities, auditing permission changes, and analyzing specific indicators of compromise (IoCs):

- **Monitoring TCC Database Changes:**
  - Regularly audit and monitor file integrity and changes to `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` and `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`.
  - Tools such as OSSEC, Tripwire, or File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) solutions can be used to detect unauthorized modifications.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**
  - EDR tools like CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, or Carbon Black can detect suspicious behaviors related to unauthorized TCC modifications.
  - Monitor for unexpected processes or scripts accessing or modifying TCC databases.
- **System Audit Logs and macOS Unified Logs:**
  - Enable and review macOS audit logs (`auditd`) for suspicious activities related to file modifications or unauthorized SQLite database access.
  - Utilize macOS Unified Logging (`log` command) to detect abnormal behaviors related to permission grants or modifications.
- **Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection:**
  - Leverage behavioral analytics solutions to detect anomalies, such as unusual permission grants or unexpected application access to sensitive resources.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Unrecognized or unauthorized applications listed in TCC permissions.
  - Unexpected modifications or timestamps in TCC.db files.
  - Suspicious command-line executions involving `sqlite3` or scripts targeting TCC databases.

## Why it is Important to Detect This Technique

Early detection of TCC Manipulation is critical due to the potential severe impacts on systems and networks, including:

- **Privacy Violations:**
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive user data such as contacts, emails, calendar events, photos, and location information.
- **Espionage and Surveillance:**
  - Attackers gaining access to camera or microphone permissions can conduct covert surveillance, leading to theft of intellectual property or confidential communications.
- **Data Exfiltration and Leakage:**
  - Attackers with manipulated TCC permissions can exfiltrate sensitive data, leading to reputational damage, financial loss, and regulatory compliance violations.
- **Persistence and Difficulty of Remediation:**
  - Attackers leveraging TCC manipulation can maintain persistent access, complicating incident response and remediation efforts.
- **Facilitation of Further Attacks:**
  - Unauthorized TCC modifications may serve as stepping stones for subsequent malicious activities, including lateral movement, privilege escalation, and additional malware deployment.

Early detection allows security teams to mitigate these risks promptly, minimize potential damage, and prevent the escalation of malicious activities.

## Examples

Real-world examples of TCC Manipulation attacks include:

- **XCSSET Malware (2020):**
  - Attack Scenario:
    - Malware injected into Xcode projects to spread among macOS developers.
    - Manipulated TCC permissions to access sensitive data, including Safari cookies and credentials, screenshots, and microphone recordings.
  - Tools Used:
    - Malicious scripts and SQLite commands to directly modify the TCC database.
  - Impacts:
    - Data theft, unauthorized access to user credentials, and covert surveillance.
- **OSX.Dok Malware (2017):**
  - Attack Scenario:
    - Malware distributed via phishing emails, tricking users into installing malicious applications.
    - Obtained root privileges, modified TCC permissions to bypass macOS security mechanisms.
  - Tools Used:
    - Shell scripts and built-in command-line utilities (`sqlite3`) to alter TCC permissions.
  - Impacts:
    - Enabled attackers to intercept encrypted traffic, steal sensitive information, and maintain persistent access.
- **WindTail Malware (2018):**
  - Attack Scenario:
    - Targeted macOS users via phishing campaigns.

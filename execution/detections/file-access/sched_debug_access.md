# Sched Debug Access

## Quick Explanation

The `sched_debug_access` recipe identifies unauthorized access to the `/proc/sched_debug` file, which is critical for the kernel's task management. Such access can lead to defense evasion by altering process scheduling, potentially resulting in privilege escalation and other malicious activities. This detection aligns with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques T1089 (Disabling Security Tools) and T1562 (Impair Defenses), indicating an intention to weaken system defenses and making the system more vulnerable to further attacks.

**Importance**: High

### Analysis of the Event

The `sched_debug_access` detection event highlights a high-risk security incident where unauthorized access or manipulation of the `/proc/sched_debug` file on a Linux system has been detected. This file contains detailed information about the scheduler, which is critical for managing processes in the kernel. Unauthorized access can enable an attacker to alter how processes are scheduled, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other forms of defense evasion.

The method associated with this detection, impairing defenses, aligns closely with MITRE ATT\&CK techniques such as T1089 (Disabling Security Tools) and T1562 (Impair Defenses). This tactic involves disabling or circumventing security measures in place, making the system more vulnerable to subsequent exploitation. Attackers can leverage this access to bypass intrusion detection systems (IDS), evade antivirus software, and manipulate logging mechanisms.

Historical attack patterns indicate that attackers often use covert channels like DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data from compromised systems. By altering process scheduling, an attacker could hide malicious activities by blending them with legitimate traffic or by manipulating timing to avoid detection during forensic investigations. Additionally, this form of evasion can be used in conjunction with other tactics such as T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) to execute scripts that further compromise the system.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity are elevated. Unauthorized access to critical files can be indicative of a compromised build environment where attackers insert malicious code or alter dependencies in the build artifacts. This could lead to the deployment of compromised software across multiple environments.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment are heightened. The staging environment is often less monitored than production, making it a prime target for attackers seeking to test their exploits or exfiltrate sensitive information without immediate detection. Any vulnerabilities exploited in the staging phase can be carried over into production.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are significant concerns. Once an attacker gains unauthorized access to critical files like `/proc/sched_debug`, they can establish long-term persistence mechanisms such as rootkits or backdoors. This allows for continuous monitoring of system activities and the execution of further attacks without detection.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Audit and Review Access Logs**: Immediately review access logs to identify unauthorized access attempts to the `/proc/sched_debug` file. Determine if any unauthorized users or processes have accessed this file.
2. **Secure the Build Environment**: Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on the build environment to prevent unauthorized access. Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to critical files and directories.
3. **Validate Build Artifacts**: Conduct integrity checks on build artifacts to ensure no malicious code has been introduced. Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of dependencies and final builds.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of the staging environment to detect unauthorized access and potential data leakage. Implement real-time alerts for any suspicious activities.
2. **Conduct Security Testing**: Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, to identify and mitigate potential weaknesses before moving to production.
3. **Limit Access**: Restrict access to the staging environment to essential personnel only. Implement role-based access controls and regularly review permissions.
4. **Data Protection**: Ensure that sensitive data in the staging environment is encrypted and that data leakage prevention measures are in place.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response plan to contain and investigate the unauthorized access. Isolate affected systems to prevent further compromise.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach, including how the `/proc/sched_debug` file was accessed and any subsequent actions taken by the attacker.
3. **Patch and Harden Systems**: Apply security patches and harden system configurations to prevent similar incidents. Consider implementing kernel-level security enhancements.

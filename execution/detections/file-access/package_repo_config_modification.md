# Package Repo Config Modification

## Quick Explanation

The `package_repo_config_modification` recipe identifies changes to package management configuration files. Such modifications can signal attempts to bypass defenses by redirecting the system's software sources to potentially malicious repositories. In a CI/CD environment, these changes pose significant risks, including software supply chain compromise and the introduction of vulnerabilities into production systems.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Package repository file modification  
**Tactic**: [Defense Evasion](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005)  
**Technique**: [Modify System Image](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005/t1601)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Patch System Image](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005/t1601/t1601.001)  
**Importance**: Medium

### Analysis of the Event

The `package_repo_config_modification` detection event is triggered when critical package management configuration files are altered across various Linux distributions. This includes files like `/etc/apt/sources.list`, `/etc/yum.conf`, and others that are essential for managing package installation sources. Unauthorized changes to these files can indicate an attempt to evade defenses by altering the system's software source to potentially malicious repositories.

The identified method, `modify_system_image`, suggests that the attack aims to persist malicious changes or configurations within the system, which could be used for further exploitation or maintaining access. In MITRE ATT\&CK terminology, this behavior aligns with techniques involving persistence through system process manipulation and could lead to broader impacts, such as malware delivery or unauthorized command execution.

This type of detection is crucial in a CI/CD environment where integrity and trust in the build process are paramount. Alterations in these configuration files can lead to the introduction of compromised packages into production environments, potentially resulting in a widespread security breach. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious software through seemingly legitimate package updates or by redirecting the system to repositories controlled by adversaries.

Historically, such attacks have been observed in various contexts, including the compromise of critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. A notable example is the SolarWinds Orion supply chain attack, where attackers modified the build process to inject a backdoor into software updates. This demonstrates the severity of risks associated with unauthorized modifications to package repositories.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity can arise from unauthorized changes in repository configurations. Attackers may exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious dependencies or altering build artifacts, leading to a compromised CI/CD pipeline that propagates insecure code across the development lifecycle.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment are heightened when package repositories are tampered with. This can result in staging environments being used as conduits for lateral movement within an organizationâ€™s network or to exfiltrate sensitive data before it reaches the production environment.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are significant concerns in a compromised production environment. Malicious repositories can deliver payloads that establish backdoors, enable attackers to maintain long-term access, or facilitate further exploitation of vulnerabilities within the network.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Immediate Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of all recent changes to package management configuration files within your CI/CD pipelines. Verify the legitimacy of any modifications and ensure they align with expected changes.
2. **Revert Unauthorized Changes**: If unauthorized modifications are detected, revert them immediately to restore the original, trusted configuration files.
3. **Review Access Controls**: Evaluate and tighten access controls around CI/CD environments to ensure only authorized personnel can modify configuration files.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Validate Integrity**: Check the integrity of all package management configuration files in the staging environment to ensure they have not been tampered with.
2. **Conduct Security Testing**: Perform comprehensive security testing to identify any potential vulnerabilities introduced by unauthorized repository modifications.
3. **Restrict Repository Access**: Limit the staging environment's access to only trusted and verified package repositories to prevent unauthorized changes.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Rollback**: If unauthorized changes are detected, consider rolling back to a previous stable state to mitigate potential risks.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response procedure to investigate the scope and impact of the unauthorized modifications in the production environment.
3. **Strengthen Defenses**: Implement additional security measures, such as network segmentation and enhanced logging, to detect and prevent future unauthorized access or modifications.
4. **Review and Update Policies**: Regularly review and update security policies and procedures to address any gaps that may have allowed the unauthorized modifications to occur.

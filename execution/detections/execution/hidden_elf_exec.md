# Hidden Elf Exec

## Quick Explanation

The `hidden_elf_exec` recipe identifies the execution of hidden ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, a tactic employed by attackers to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised systems. This method often involves rootkits and advanced persistent threats (APTs), where attackers conceal artifacts to obscure malicious activities. Detecting such hidden executables within the CI/CD pipeline is crucial as they can lead to severe security breaches if merged into production code.

**Technique**: [Hide Artifacts](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0005/t1564)

**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

This detection identifies the execution of hidden ELF files, a common technique used by attackers to bypass traditional security mechanisms and maintain persistence on compromised systems. The use of hidden executable files is often associated with rootkits or APTs that employ sophisticated evasion tactics.

By leveraging technologies such as eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and other tracing techniques, Jibril monitors file executions and flags those that match specific patterns indicative of concealment, such as filenames starting with a dot. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework under the Defense Evasion tactic, where attackers use rootkit-like behavior to obscure their activities from standard monitoring tools.

Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the system's file management or security controls to execute hidden ELF files without raising immediate alarms. Such techniques can enable prolonged presence within a network and facilitate further attacks such as credential theft and data exfiltration. The detection of these hidden files is critical for preventing long-term persistence risks and lateral movement across systems.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Detecting hidden ELF file execution during the CI/CD pipeline poses significant risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity. Attackers may introduce malicious code through compromised dependencies or by concealing executables within legitimate files, leading to potential security breaches if such code is merged into production.

#### Implications for Staging

In a staging environment, adversarial testing can expose data leakage and insider threats, especially when unauthorized access risks are present before the final deployment of software. Hidden ELF files in this phase may be used to test attack vectors or exfiltrate sensitive information without detection.

#### Implications for Production

The implications for production environments include long-term persistence risks, lateral movement across systems, credential theft, and data exfiltration by APTs leveraging hidden executables. Attackers can exploit these covert channels to maintain a foothold within the network and launch further attacks undetected.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Audit and Review Build Logs**: Thoroughly review all build and deployment logs for any unusual activity or unauthorized file executions. Look specifically for executions of files that are typically hidden (e.g., filenames starting with a dot).
2. **Strengthen Dependency Management**: Verify the integrity and source of all dependencies used in the build process. Consider using trusted and signed repositories and enforce strict version controls.
3. **Implement Change Management**: Establish a rigorous change management process that includes code reviews and approvals for any changes made to the codebase, especially those affecting system-level operations.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: Regularly perform penetration testing with a focus on uncovering hidden files and rootkits. Use this as an opportunity to simulate potential attack vectors and identify vulnerabilities.
2. **Validate Software Integrity**: Before moving from staging to production, validate the integrity of the software by checking for hidden files and ensuring that all components are as expected.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Forensic Analysis**: In the event of a detection, conduct a forensic analysis to understand the source and impact of the hidden ELF file. Determine how the file was introduced and which part of the system was compromised.
2. **Update and Patch Systems**: Regularly update and patch all systems to close any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to introduce hidden ELF files. Ensure that all security patches are applied promptly.
3. **Educate and Train Staff**: Conduct regular training sessions with all IT staff and developers to recognize the signs of hidden file executions and the importance of security best practices in preventing such threats.

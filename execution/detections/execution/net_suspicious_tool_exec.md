# Net Suspicious Tool Exec

## Quick Explanation

The `net_suspicious_tool_exec` recipe identifies the execution of network tools potentially used for command and control activities, such as `curl`, `ssh`, and `wget`. These tools are often executed with IP addresses as arguments, which can indicate unauthorized communication with external systems. This detection is critical as it may reveal vulnerabilities or malicious code within a CI/CD pipeline, posing significant risks to data integrity and organizational reputation.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Network suspicious tool execution  
**Tactic**: [Discovery](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0007)  
**Technique**: [Network Service Discovery](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0007/t1046)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The `net_suspicious_tool_exec` event is triggered when network tools that are potentially used for command and control (C2) activities are executed. These include common networking utilities such as `curl`, `dig`, `ftp`, `mtr`, `netcat`, `nslookup`, `ping`, `rsync`,`scp`, `ssh`, `telnet`, `wget`, and `whois`, among others. The detection mechanism monitors the execution of these tools in specific contexts that might indicate unauthorized or malicious activities.

According to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, this event falls under the Command and Control tactic. Adversaries often use Web Protocols (T1071) as a C2 mechanism to maintain control over compromised hosts by sending commands and receiving responses through standard internet protocols like HTTP/HTTPS or DNS. The detection of such tools suggests that an unauthorized actor might be using these utilities for data exfiltration, remote command execution, or establishing persistent access within the environment.

Historically, attackers have leveraged network tools to bypass security controls via techniques such as DNS tunneling (T1093) and covert channels (T1218). For instance, during the 2017 NotPetya attack, adversaries used `ping` commands to establish a foothold in the environment. Additionally, supply chain risks have been exploited by embedding malicious code within dependencies or scripts that invoke these network tools.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

The presence of suspicious network tool executions during CI/CD pipeline execution may indicate that recent source code changes have introduced vulnerabilities or malicious code attempting to communicate with external entities. This could lead to unauthorized data exfiltration, remote command execution, and other forms of compromise within the CI environment. If such activities are not detected and mitigated early in the development lifecycle, they can propagate through subsequent deployment stages.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, adversarial testing might occur, leading to potential data leakage or insider threats. Unauthorized access risks may arise if staging systems lack proper security controls, enabling attackers to exploit vulnerabilities before production deployment. This could result in compromised builds and increased attack surfaces for adversaries.

#### Implications for Production

Production environments face long-term persistence risks (T1569), lateral movement (T1021), credential theft (T1078), data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT). Adversaries may use these network tools to establish a foothold within the environment and maintain persistence by regularly communicating with external command and control servers. Lateral movement can occur through compromised staging environments or direct access from external systems.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Examine any recent commits or merges for the introduction of scripts or dependencies that could be invoking these network tools. Focus on changes made to build scripts, configuration files, and third-party libraries.
2. **Audit Build and Deployment Scripts**: Ensure that all scripts used in the CI/CD process are reviewed and approved by security teams. Look for unauthorized modifications or the inclusion of suspicious network commands.
3. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Perform a comprehensive security audit of the CI/CD pipeline to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers using these tools.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Isolate and Scan the Staging Environment**: Temporarily isolate the staging environment from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration. Conduct a thorough security scan to identify and remove any malicious elements.
2. **Verify Integrity of Build Artifacts**: Ensure that all artifacts deployed in the staging environment are verified against their source to confirm their integrity and authenticity.
3. **Implement Strict Access Controls**: Review and enforce strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the staging environment.
4. **Regular Security Assessments**: Schedule regular security assessments of the staging environment to detect and respond to unauthorized changes or suspicious activities promptly.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response protocol to assess the extent of potential compromise. Focus on identifying any lateral movements or data exfiltration attempts.
2. **Network Segmentation**: Implement or reinforce network segmentation to limit the spread of potential attacks and to isolate critical systems from compromised areas.
3. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Review existing security policies and procedures to ensure they adequately address the detection, prevention, and response to the use of suspicious network tools in the production environment.

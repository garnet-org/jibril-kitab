# Net MitM Tool Exec

## Quick Explanation

The `net_mitmit_tool_exec` detection identifies the execution of network man-in-the-middle (MitM) tools, which are used to intercept, modify, and log network traffic. This activity can potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. The presence of such tools indicates attempts to capture or manipulate network traffic, posing significant risks to both CI/CD pipelines and production environments if not addressed promptly.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Network man-in-the-middle tool execution  
**Tactic**: [Credential Access](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0006)  
**Technique**: [Adversary In The Middle](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0006/t1557)  
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The detection of the `net_mitm_tool_exec` event signifies the execution of MitM tools within the monitored environment. These tools, such as `ettercap`, `mitmproxy`, and`bettercap`, are designed to intercept, modify, and log network traffic, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. The MITRE ATT\&CK framework categorizes this activity under T1046 (Network Sniffing), which is a Discovery technique used by adversaries to gather information about the target environment.

The detection mechanism utilizes eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and other tracing techniques to monitor the execution of specific files associated with known MitM tools. This monitoring approach can detect both direct tool executions and indirect invocations through scripts or other programs. The presence of such tools suggests that an adversary might be attempting to capture network traffic, which could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to network resources, and further exploitation.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

In a CI/CD pipeline context, the detection of MitM tool execution during code integration or deployment phases can indicate that recent changes may include functionality related to network traffic interception. This poses significant risks to both the build process and production systems if the compromised code is merged and deployed. Unauthorized network sniffing can expose sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials used in automated processes. It could also compromise data integrity by modifying or injecting malicious content into the traffic.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, adversarial testing may involve the use of MitM tools to simulate attacks and assess system vulnerabilities before production deployment. However, unauthorized access through these tools can lead to data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized modifications that could affect the final product's security posture. Additionally, covert channels established using DNS tunneling or other covert communication methods might allow attackers to bypass network egress controls.

#### Implications for Production

In a production environment, long-term persistence risks are heightened due to MitM tool execution. Adversaries may use these tools for lateral movement across networks, credential theft, and data exfiltration. Advanced persistent threats (APT) often leverage such tools as part of their multi-stage attack strategies. The presence of MitM tools can also indicate that an attacker has already gained a foothold within the network, potentially allowing them to maintain persistence over extended periods.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent further unauthorized data access or manipulation.
2. **Audit Recent Changes**: Review recent commits and build logs for any unusual activity or unauthorized changes that could have introduced the MitM tool.
3. **Strengthen Security Measures**: Implement stricter security controls on the CI/CD pipeline, including more robust code review processes and enhanced monitoring of network traffic.
4. **Incident Response**: Initiate a formal incident response to investigate the source and extent of the breach, involving both internal security teams and external experts if necessary.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Perform a thorough security audit of the staging environment to identify how the MitM tool was executed and assess any potential data leakage or unauthorized modifications.
2. **Review and Update Access Controls**: Ensure that access controls are strictly enforced, reviewing who has the authority to deploy and test in staging environments.
3. **Simulate Attacks**: Regularly schedule controlled, simulated attacks to better understand potential vulnerabilities and prepare for actual threats.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network traffic logs to identify any suspicious activity or data exfiltration attempts that may have occurred due to the MitM tool.
2. **Credential Rotation**: Rotate all sensitive credentials that could have been exposed while the MitM tool was active.
3. **Update and Patch Systems**: Ensure that all systems are updated and patched to the latest security standards to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

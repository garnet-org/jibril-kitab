# Net Suspicious Tool Shell

## Quick Explanation

The `net_suspicious_tool_shell` recipe identifies potential reverse shell executions using network tools. Reverse shells enable attackers to gain remote access by connecting from the target machine to the attacker's machine, often bypassing firewalls. A successful reverse shell execution can result in severe security breaches, including data exfiltration and unauthorized access. In a CI/CD pipeline, triggering this event indicates that recent code changes may have introduced vulnerabilities.

### Information

**Description**: Network suspicious tool shell extension  
**Tactic**: [Execution](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0002)  
**Technique**: [Command And Scripting Interpreter](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0002/t1059)  
**Sub-Technique**: [Unix Shell](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0002/t1059/t1059.004)  
**Importance**: Critical, Medium

### Analysis of the Event

This detection event highlights a potential reverse shell execution using network tools such as `curl`, `wget`, `lynx`, and others, including netcat variants like `nc` and`ncat`. Reverse shells are commonly used by attackers to gain remote access to a system by establishing a connection from the target machine back to the attacker's machine, often bypassing firewall restrictions. This technique is categorized under MITRE ATT\&CK tactics such as T1021 (Remote Services) and T1090 (Proxy) which involve using legitimate network protocols to establish command-and-control communication.

The detection mechanism utilizes eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and other tracing techniques to monitor for specific patterns in the arguments passed to these network tools. For example, it looks for known shell extensions in arguments or the use of netcat's `-e` or `--exec` flags to execute a shell (`/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`). These patterns indicate attempts to establish unauthorized remote control over the system.

The critical importance assigned to this detection underscores its severity. Successful reverse shell executions can lead to significant security breaches, including data exfiltration, further system compromise, and persistent unauthorized access. Attackers often use these methods to maintain long-term persistence within a network, allowing them to perform lateral movement (T1027) and credential theft (T1056).

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

Risks related to build process compromise, dependency poisoning, and artifact integrity include the potential for attackers to inject malicious code during the build phase. This can result in compromised binaries or scripts that are then distributed across environments. Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities introduced through supply chain attacks (T1098) by compromising dependencies or using malicious updates.

#### Implications for Staging

Adversarial testing, data leakage, insider threats, and unauthorized access risks before production deployment mean that staging environments can be used as a stepping stone to gain deeper network insights. Attackers might use these environments to test their capabilities and identify weaknesses without causing immediate harm, which could later be exploited in the production environment.

#### Implications for Production

Long-term persistence risks, lateral movement, credential theft, data exfiltration, and advanced persistent threats (APT) are significant concerns. Once a reverse shell is established, attackers can leverage it for long-term access to steal sensitive information or deploy additional malware. They may also use this foothold to move laterally within the network, escalating privileges and compromising other systems.

### Recommended Actions

For the recipe `net_suspicious_tool_shell`:

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Review Recent Changes**: Examine the most recent code changes and build scripts for any unusual or unauthorized modifications. Focus on any new or modified usage of network tools like `curl`, `wget`, or `nc`.
2. **Audit Build Tools and Dependencies**: Ensure that all tools and dependencies used in the build process are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with. Consider using tools like dependency checkers to scan for vulnerabilities.
3. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Perform a thorough security audit of the CI/CD pipeline to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This should include a review of access controls and security policies.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Isolate and Analyze the Environment**: Immediately isolate the affected staging environment to prevent potential spread or escalation. Analyze logs and system artifacts to understand the scope and method of the attack.
2. **Reset Credentials and Secrets**: As a precaution, reset all credentials and secrets that could have been exposed in the staging environment. This includes API keys, database credentials, and service accounts.
3. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: Perform targeted penetration testing focusing on network services and reverse shell vulnerabilities to identify weaknesses in the environment.
4. **Review and Tighten Access Controls**: Ensure that access controls are strictly enforced and follow the principle of least privilege. Review user roles and permissions to limit unnecessary access to sensitive resources.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an immediate incident response to contain and assess the impact of the detected reverse shell. This should include isolating affected systems and preserving logs and forensic evidence.
2. **Update and Patch Systems**: Ensure that all systems are updated and patched to the latest security standards to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
3. **Security Awareness Training**: Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees to recognize and respond to security threats, emphasizing the importance of security in day-to-day operations.

# File Access And Execution

## What is File Access and Execution Monitoring?

**Runtime Detection**: Jibril combines two powerful monitoring capabilities—[file access](file_access.md) and [execution](execution.md) monitoring—to create a comprehensive security solution. This integrated approach tracks both how processes interact with the filesystem and which programs are being executed, providing complete visibility into system activity and enabling sophisticated threat detection.

## How Does File Access and Execution Monitoring Work?

1. **Comprehensive File Operation Tracking**: Jibril intercepts and logs every file operation in the system, including opens, reads, writes, modifications, deletions, and permission changes. For each operation, it records detailed metadata such as:
   * The exact file path and name
   * Timestamp of the access
   * Process ID and name that performed the operation
   * User context under which the access occurred
   * Type of operation performed
   * Amount of data read or written
2. **Binary Execution Tracking**: Simultaneously, Jibril continuously monitors all program executions on the system, capturing detailed information about every binary that runs. This includes system utilities, user applications, scripts, and other executable content.
3. **Argument Pattern Analysis**: When programs execute, Jibril captures and analyzes their command-line arguments. Certain argument patterns can indicate malicious intent—for example, unusual flag combinations, obfuscated commands, or attempts to exploit parameter vulnerabilities.
4. **Execution Context Evaluation**: Jibril examines the conditions surrounding program execution, including:
   * The user context (particularly privilege level and whether elevation occurred)
   * Timing patterns (executions during unusual hours)
   * Parent-child process relationships
   * Directory location of execution (e.g., from temporary folders)
   * Environmental variables and system state
5. **Correlation Engine**: By combining [file access](file_access.md) and [execution](execution.md) data, Jibril can establish powerful correlations between:
   * Which processes are accessing which files
   * The sequence of file operations relative to program executions
   * Patterns of file access that precede or follow specific program executions
   * Unusual combinations of file access and program execution that may indicate malicious activity
6. **eBPF-powered Implementation**: Using eBPF technology, Jibril attaches to kernel functions responsible for both file operations and process execution, allowing it to:
   * Monitor system activity with minimal performance impact
   * Operate without modifying the kernel or requiring special modules
   * Maintain visibility even into privileged processes

## Where Does File Access and Execution Monitoring Operate?

Jibril's monitoring capabilities operate at multiple levels within the system:

* **Kernel Space**: eBPF hooks intercept both file-related and execution-related syscalls directly in the kernel
* **VFS Layer**: File monitoring at the Virtual File System layer provides visibility across all filesystem types
* **Process Creation Points**: Execution monitoring occurs at the precise moment when new processes are spawned
* **Binary Loading Phase**: Interception during the ELF loader process provides early detection opportunities
* **System-wide Coverage**: All file operations and execution events across the entire system are captured, regardless of which user initiated them

## Why is File Access and Execution Monitoring Important?

1. **Comprehensive Attack Surface Coverage**: By monitoring both [file access](file_access.md) and [execution](execution.md), Jibril covers the two most fundamental aspects of system operation—how processes interact with data and what code is running. Most attack vectors involve one or both of these activities.
2. **Advanced Correlation Capabilities**: The combination of file access and execution data enables sophisticated pattern detection that would be impossible with either capability alone. For example, Jibril can identify when a process accesses sensitive files immediately after being executed from an unusual location.
3. **Early Detection**: By monitoring at both the file and execution levels, threats can be identified at their initial stages before they achieve persistence or lateral movement.
4. **Reduced False Positives**: The rich contextual information from both monitoring systems allows for more accurate threat determination compared to single-vector detection approaches.
5. **Forensic Value**: The detailed historical record of both file operations and program executions provides invaluable evidence for incident response, allowing security teams to reconstruct attack timelines and understand breach methodologies.

## Conclusion

The integration of [file access](file_access.md) and [execution](execution.md) monitoring forms a cornerstone of Jibril's defense strategy. By leveraging eBPF technology to observe both how processes interact with files and what code is running on the system, Jibril creates a comprehensive security monitoring solution that can detect sophisticated threats with minimal system impact. This dual approach provides unparalleled visibility into system activity, creating a powerful detection mechanism for modern security threats.
